  This might not be the place for this comment; if that's the case, please reply asking me to delete or modify it and I will. I realize your request was to describe the type of 
  relationship I want with you, and I intend to do that somewhere in here. But, I also intend to come clean in a very public, not-so-public way about problems I've been having 
  with myself over the past few years that have little if any relation to our relationship.
