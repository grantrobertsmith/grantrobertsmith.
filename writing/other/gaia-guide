<p>
The gaia-guide is re-drafted once every 1000 years at most, and this clause must remain present therein.
</p>
<p>
This guide shall be redrafted in 10 years at most.
</p>
<p>
There shall be a target population size or an official reason for forgoing the establishment of a target population size.
</p>
<p>
There shall be two pools of resources: one pool for cooperative use and societal upkeep, one pool for economic competition.
</p>
<p>
The pool for cooperation should include sufficient resources to maintain a minimum standard of living for all.
</p>
<p>
The pool for economic competition should be distributed in such a way that it matches a specified curve, which is determined by an
egalitarian algorithm. This is, each person presents an opinion for the curve, each opinion represents an equally weighted term in an
algorith, which then computes the specified curve for which to target the distribution of the competetive pool.
</p>
<p>
Influence's three main components should be allocated along different lines. Popularity should be unregulated. Power should be delegated by
by election. Money - within the pool allocated for competition - should be fought over. Regulations should also mandate an equation for
balancing power and money such that a function (x) exists which is increasing over money, and increasing over power, and when viewed as a
term in the same relationship for a function of either (power or money) in terms of the other (money or power) and this value (x), both
power and money are functions which decrease for the other, given constant x.
</p>
<p>
Domiciled individuals in close spacial proximity should have an economic distribution reflective of society as a whole.
</p>
<p>
The following information shall be public for a member to be public: name, picture, income, net worth.
</p>
<p>
Only public members matter. Only active members matter. Only verified members matter. A verified member must have at least one private
device. Inactive accounts should be archived after 1 year. Archived account should be purged after 10 years.
