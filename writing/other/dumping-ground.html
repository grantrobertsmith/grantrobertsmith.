<p>2014-09-19. This is a public diary.</p>
<p>
  I love <<name redacted>>. A lot. She's the second person that I've really wanted all of, for whom I also theel that I know what all of 
  is, to a significant degree.

<p>
  And still, we are so different that any union is sure to be rife with compromises. Big important compromises: children, career, 
  friendships, hobbies, etc. So why is it that one still wants something so fundamentally problematic. Is it timing, luck, fate or fortune? 
  Is it biology, physiology or psychology? Is it romance, magic or something else?
</p>
<p>
  I think for me it's balance. Being able to respect and identify with another competent, rational, intelligent human being and share our 
  observations, thoughts and interpretations having them be different, even mutually exclusive, and yet still valid to each individual 
  separately. Having the divergence be so close to the core, the most desirable, passionate relationships are inherently the most 
  problematic. Hopefully I'm just too young and have yet to discover true love, something similar yet simpler.

  I'm making this into a public diary. It is not a blog. It is for me. It's public, perhaps selfishly, for me as well. Because I want to 
  live without secrets, it is for me, my freedom.
</p>
<p>The below content was written a few months ago and is unrelated to the above decision.</p>
<p>
  I received my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering from UW Madison in 2010. Still trying to develop life goals, I worked at 
  Epic in the Technical Services role for 2.8 years where I gained a wonderful respect and appreciation for technology's ability to 
  transform entire sectors of the economy. In order to pursue a greater understanding of software and business, I left Epic and started 
  work at EatStreet.com, a Madison startup creating an internet ordering platform for independent local restaurants and small chains. 
  Currently, I do freelance work for another pre-market venture aimed at helping accounting practices go paper-free, while also continuing 
  to learn and work at EatStreet.
</p>
<p>
  Passion for understanding others' ideas, community, equality and global human development motivates me far more than money, influence, 
  power and at times even more than relationships. At TEDx Madison 2014, I want to learn about and to try to understand other people's 
  motivations, ideas and experiences and how they relate to my own passions and motivations. If requested, I would happily want to put 
  together a talk on observations regarding current trends in the development of global human culture and society (diplomacy/international 
  law, economic and financial trends, language/housing/clothing/food, technology, health, education, etc.; basically an overview of - as a 
  species - where we've come from, where we are, and perhaps touching briefly on some places we might yet go); I would want to present it 
  if I thought it was good enough and if others validated that opinion.

  Basically two things can happen when one of the leading super powers finally goes so far as to simply not pay back our debts in an 
  agreeable manner. War and forgiveness. For the sake of understanding how the citizens of the lender nations feel in this circumstance, 
  let's pretend that the US is actually a lender nation, and that the EU is actually a debtor nation that owes the US trillions of dollars 
  and is about to default on it's debt and working on renegotiating that debt with the US. The president is working with Congress to decide

  If all of mankind were represented by a single individual, how well are that person's needs being met? And, what could that person change 
  to more adequately meet it's own needs? I'm American, specifically united statesian, so I'm going to go ahead and assume this person has 
  needs based off an average American lifestyle, but if you're reading this from another country, go ahead and extract and augment facets 
  of individual need as you see fit. Yes, I'm applying global statistics to an American mindset of needs (just to be clear).

  Choosing your relationships is largely considered a fundamental right in our society. True, this is not necessarily the case in other 
  cultures, but in the United States, you can marry, divorce, disown, disinherit, inherit, etc. pretty much at will. There are a few 
  notable exceptions: 1) you cannot choose to add to your family outside of the one living spouse per person rule (and in some states that 
  person still has to be of the opposite gender) and 2) acknowledgement of children is forcible under certain circumstances. These 
  circumstances disproportionately affect men, as physically, pregnancy disproportionately affects women.

  Sex should never, ever be tied directly with offspring unless it's someone's, and preferably multiple people's choice. Abortion should be 
  legal because a person's right to the pursuit of happiness through sexual pleasure should trump the state's right to protect the 
  potentiality of human life (context matters, so certainly there are other epochs when this is not true). Abortion should be legal right 
  now. But it's not.
</p>
<p>
  Somehow, the state still maintains that it has a vested interest in protecting the well being of a fetus, and that it's interest in doing 
  so increases as the fetus matures. This is probably wrong, but most people cannot yet see it that way; they don't want to see it. Why 
  does the state have a vested interest in protecting an unborn human? Presumably, we assume from a legal standpoint, reflecting societies 
  values, that human life is inherently valuable to the society, and therefore this makes sense. The value of the human life comes in many 
  forms - it's joyous and harmonious relationships to others, the contributions is makes to maintaining our species and our societal 
  structure, etc. I think we can all agree that human life is generally valuable in both quality and quantity. But, like anything, too much 
  is not good. If the planet were filled entirely with humans we couldn't move, we couldn't leave, and we would all pretty much get bored 
  and want to die. Economically, we probably want a population size that optimizes for both quantity and quality of life. At some point, we 
  don't want more people. What would be some good indicators that we have enough people? And at that point, does the government still have 
  a vested interest in protecting an unborn human? The answer is that we have a vested interest in agreeing to policy structures locally, 
  nationally, globally that help regulate the population in such a way that we generally all agree is mutually beneficial. This is 
  incredibly difficult. Ideally, we would not regulate, people would just have a small number of children, and thankfully, this happens 
  naturally to some extent.
</p>
<p>
  People are unjustifiably hubris when it comes to defending the nature of our species. We have failed before, and we will fail again. What 
  we can hope to achieve is to learn from our failures and lessen the magnitude of each one consecutively. In a way, that will happen when 
  we ruin our planet and or have a lasting catastrophic global depression sometime over the course of the next several decades. Let's 
  compare our global civilization to that of the Easter Islanders. We likely won't fail in the sense that we will all have to leave the 
  planet, because 1) we can't leave and because 2) extinction would require an incredibly extreme change of global climate, potentially 
  beyond the likes of climate change and/or nuclear war (though I would be interested in a well though-out counter claim). We will fail in 
  the sense that we're effectively lowering the carrying capacity of our planet in the long run and at a minimum we will undergo massive 
  penalties to the quality of life experienced by human beings across the globe, and potentially a sizable loss in the quantity of that 
  life as well.
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately, my point isn't that abortion should be legal - it should, but that's not my point really. My point is that it should be legal 
  so that we correctly balance our desire for quantity of life against our desire for quality of life. We want abortion to be legal, all 
  abortion. And, we want everyone to feel safe and secure about meeting their sexual needs. Let's legalize all abortion where it's someones 
  choice. Forward!

  Today sucked. I wasn't able to focus at work, partially because I was attempting to do things that are fairly boring like write and 
  validate unit tests for a bunch of old xml endpoints, and partially because I was distracted by my incessant desire to feel in control. 
  Grams asked me recently if I felt in control of my life and I just sort of laughed. I think that I would have said yes until about six or 
  nine months ago. It's still quite a strange question, what is control. Our understanding of the universe seems to be that things are 
  largely determined by the nature of random details, and that control is largely an abstract illusion. Even when I know what I want, why I 
  want it, and approximately how to get it, I can fail to actually act toward what I want, or I can be distracted or realize that maybe I 
  don't want it after all. Worst of all, you can end up getting either something you didn't plan for that is perceived as negative (this 
  made me cry today - http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-hardest-thing-you-have-ever-done) or you can get something that you explicitly 
  planned against.
