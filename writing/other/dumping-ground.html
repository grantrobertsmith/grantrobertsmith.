<h1>This is the Dumping Ground</h1>
<p>Here are all the thing's I've written of which I have a record, unless they are somewhere else on this site or at my parent's house.</p>
<h2>Things I Am Actively Working On</h2>
<h3>Here are some notes for the short story about Bali, politics and neural implants</h3>
<p>
  Jacob hardly knew Ditya, so he felt more uncertainty than foreboding toward the impending conversation. 
</p>
<p>
  Maybe he could swipe right and match with her near the beginning of his prep time (or even right before he met with her). In this case, 
  Ditya would get a notification, which would help her in the upcoming discussion, giving both of them more knowledge but she would clearly 
  have had more time to prepare based on that knowledge since she could have preallocated processing resources to the scenario-event in 
  which they matched. Presumably they are both young professionals around 30 years old. Seems fine to introduce sexual tension right away 
  in this scenario since that would likely play a part in real life if they are both single, successful, smart, attractive, etc. They would 
  naturally make a good pair if they got on well.
</p>
<p>
  He's definitely going to be blindsided at the start of the conversation. He's expecting her to be more typical and less power-seeking.
</p>
<p>
  My goals for this conversation are to develop a romantica interest and power-oriented teamwork between the two figures. I also want to 
  introduce other forces at play, the environmentalists and some specific character representative of them, say J'na, who is originally 
  from South Africa, and the national government. I also want to mention some international force in passing, but not really give anything 
  away about that specifically yet. (Maybe the Galapagos could recently have "liberated" itself as a territory.) Her goals are to get them 
  working together in a way that pushes out other tourism industry players... they can plan regulatory restrictions that make it so only 
  Jacob's enterprise can meet them. His goal is mostly to make more money and not get in trouble and ideally to end up with a new 
  girlfriend. He's less ambitious and more risk-averse than she is. They have tension in that he thinks her plan is to blatant and likely 
  to get a bunch of backlash as such (which is true, but from her perspective doesn't matter as long as they can get away with it).
</p>
<p>
  She'll come in, some heavy contrast from the panel meeting, dressed still very professionally, but showing a bit more skin and with her 
  hair done differently and slighly better fitting clothing. She also talks still very professionally and is the guiding force of the 
  conversation back in that direction when it strays, even if she is the one causing it to stray as she occassionally does.
</p>
<p>
  At the end, they excange personal contact info, even if they have already matched on Tinder, making that technically unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
  He's not a slouch himself, and he can keep up with her, though he's too trusting and a bit less intelligent than she is, but negligibly 
  so.
</p>

<p>
  When I remember Ender’s Game, most frequently, it’s not because of the ansible, or the Buggers or the main plot. I remember it for the 
  meaningful, open forum for political discourse that Valentine and Ender subvert before any of the main plot revs up. That’s the type of 
  governmental transparency we’ve been hoping to see evolve for a while now. One where priorities are set in the open, as a result of 
  public discourse and prediction markets, something akin to what you might find in 
  <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/15/index-posts-on-raikoth/">Raikoth</a>. Today, this seems at least remotely possible from a 
  technical standpoint. You can just take the internet, build a public forum with an associated <em>consensus function</em>, and make laws 
  that are goal oriented and metrics driven and accountable to working toward some almighty algorithm in order to increase the amount of 
  contextually defined ‘good’ in the universe. If things don’t collapse into some sort of apocalypse or dystopia, maybe we’ll get there 
  eventually.
</p>
<p>
  That still leaves the big question of what ‘there’ looks like. Equally important to consider is how would the resulting society come 
  about, out of where we are today. At this point though, I should back up and explain where we’re coming from and why this is the society 
  we want and one that we will inevitably build.
</p>
<h4>The Humanity of Tomorrow, Today</h4>
<p>
  Imagine you have all the knowledge of all the people that have ever lived or are living now. You are now, some sort of super being, a 
  single collective consciousness that possesses the memories, thoughts and feelings of each individual human. And, let’s go further. Now, 
  also assume you have infinite processing power so as to be capable of instantaneously simulating the consensus arrived at by grouping 
  any combination of individuals and allowing them to discuss any given topic to they point the decide they fully agree (assuming that 
  states of disagreement have agreed upon methods of resolution). What are you? Well, you’re definitely humanity. You have near perfect 
  understanding of the world we live on. You also have at least as good of understanding of every individual as they have of themselves. 
  You know the consensus that is being worked toward, and the only thing you don’t know is what the best possible route toward achieving 
  that consensus is. Of course, you do know what the consensus is regarding that route, so you know the route you will take. (Note that 
  this is true, even if you lack perfect knowledge of the entire universe and therefore might be making a mistake regarding that route, 
  given some additional information or processing power, etc.)
</p>
<p>
  By induction, if you back out where that entity comes from, you land on ‘a planet with sentient life’ every time. Further, that’s where 
  we’re going as a species if we don’t fail, yet the resulting society could take a variety of forms. One of my greatest fears, for 
  instance, is if our future humanity ends ub being derive from a single personality — or worse, a single person. Maybe that person became 
  a godlike entity through personal exploitation of technology and genocide of every other sentient being. The technology itself will 
  determine the embodiment of the consciousness which will in turn determine its nature. But, its personality will be determined by its 
  past. We are a sentient species - with fleshy human-shaped embodiments that interact with our surroundings in such a way so as to create 
  technology. That technology changes the possible embodiments of consciousness including our own. So, the future of any consciously 
  embodied species will be a newer consciously embodied species. Assuming technology increases the capacities of embodiments, we will 
  progressively become an ever more complicated and powerful species. The members of the species may coalesce or not (destroy one another 
  or not) as they see fit. In any case, you get a ‘more’ collectively conscious entity just because it knows more about its constituent 
  parts given the increases in knowledge and awareness provided via technology and collaboration.
</p>
<p>
  For human beings on Earth, today, the biggest question I have about our desired future embodiment(s) is ‘Where does the <em>will of the 
  individual</em> end and where does the <em>will of humanity</em> begin?’ Removing the modifiers ‘desired’ and ‘future’, I can answer the 
  question right now by simply observing how our species acts and how the institutions we’ve established organize and constrain 
  individuals’ actions. Further, we can look at the past and see how we’ve changed with increases in technology and population. And, we 
  can project that into the future to get an idea of where our species is headed as a global, social species having individuals with our 
  given cognitive capacity. While I think and hope this thought experiment results in a vision of humanity you and I find desirable, our 
  past has certainly been speckled with what I might deem ‘errors’. These errors might be defined as significant deviations from the 
  consensus function, were a consensus function to have existed at the time. More pessimistically, they might be observed as a failed 
  implementation of a consensus function.
</p>
<p>
  Normally, I keep my desired manifestation of humanity to myself and close friends because I feel the importance of my personal desires 
  pales in comparison to the desires of the sum total of our population (the consensus function). I also spend a lot of time trying to 
  predict what those might be and asking other people about their preferred incarnations for our future humanity. Still, the only vision I 
  can present with clarity is my own, and as the consensus function does not yet exist in any form of which I’m aware. I guess it’s at 
  least mildly appropriate that I contribute my opinion openly in the hope that it will one day be factored into that function after or 
  even as it’s being borne out. And thus, we arrive at the purpose of this text. I will now present my desired vision of humanity’s future 
  (a goal you might call it), a definition for when humanity has become <em>collectively conscious</em>, and a general path for how we 
  might go from where we are toward the vision I present. Even more importantly though, I’d ask that you share your thoughts, opinions and 
  visions of the same, humanity’s future, what we are, what we are becoming, the how, the why.
</p>
<h4>The Vision</h4>
<p>
  Science fiction presents to us an array of ideas with which we can construct our ideal future reality and future selves, both 
  individually and collectively. Things like interplanetary space travel, artificial intelligence and artificial bodily enhancements exist 
  on the verge of real technology and science fiction. Therefore, it’s reasonable to assume that some such innovations will come to 
  fruition over the course of the next century. Additionally, with the impact we’ve already had on our environment on a global scale, we 
  are being forced to develop technology that allows us to deal with weather and climate manipulation. But for me personally, the most 
  important aspect of humanity’s evolution is our ability to abstract, merge and alter our conscious experiences and the embodiments that 
  our consciousnesses inhabit. It’s one goal I’d like prioritized highly.
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps the most important feature of the future humanity I’m imagining combines individual consciousness and collective consciousness 
  in a dynamic fashion such that identity of the individuals and the collective(s) in which they participate are mutually dependent. In 
  this state, a collective may choose to create or transfer a given identity from one body to another. An individual might choose to merge 
  back into a collective, with or without a predetermined directive to separate again at a later point in time. While I think there will 
  likely always be some individuals that participate to a very limited degree, if at all, in the collective aspects of consciousness 
  allowed by new technology, the human collective will remain aware of any individuals residing within its local spatial domain. 
  Initially, I imagine this human collective to represent ‘everyone on Earth’ or ‘everyone in the Sun system’ or ‘everyone in the Milky 
  Way galaxy’ as consciousness spreads across the universe. A big question I have is whether the collective should ever possess the 
  ability to intentionally subvert or undermine a non-participatory individual of the species. Say a bunch of humans start sharing bodies 
  and conscious experiences and determine that this mode of existence is clearly superior, but other individuals value their unique and 
  discrete existence as an end in itself. Does the collective have responsibility to maintain the quality of life of such individuals? Do 
  we want to discourage this sort of thing as a species or encourage it? Assuming that individuals who don’t participate in the collective 
  are much less able to contribute to the growth and exploration of the species, how should resource allocation be balanced fairly? While 
  you or I may each have our own opinions, the ultimate answer must somehow reconcile our disagreements.
</p>
<h4>A Definition of <em>Collectively Conscious</em></h4>
<p>
  To think about our progress toward this vision, let’s use <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/">Nick Bostrom</a>’s three axis along 
  which he explains our development as a species: technology, insight, and coordination. Technologically, we need to, at a minimum, be 
  able to be connected to the internet at all times. With today’s technology, this would be the same as everyone carrying a cellphone at 
  all times and having an accessible connection to the internet. Insight into collective consciousness refers to our understanding of 
  ourselves and our communities. We need to have a specific physical definition and understanding of our personal needs. What does it take 
  in order to be living a thriving life? How do you measure this biologically? Do we have a survey of how successful we are at creating 
  communities of thriving individuals and does each individual who is not thriving have the ability to state so publicly to any and all 
  other individuals so as to be able to ask for help, should they so choose? This leads into the aspects that we could call coordination. 
  Are we doing things to actually help each other thrive - everyone, everywhere. At a minimum, this would require a global government and 
  some nubile implementation of a consensus function.
</p>
<p>
  Because we all inhabit the same physical universe and because that universe changes over time, you can already look at humans as sharing 
  and influencing each other’s respective conscious. But, this process looks significantly different when it’s happening via the internet 
  than when it was happening via cave paintings and face to face conversations. By this measure, one can expect future communication 
  technology to further enhance the ability to share ideas and influence people. For example, we might have trust frameworks and implants 
  that allow one person to directly control the actions of another person’s body. Say I’m sitting with you in a restaurant, but you’re 
  boxed in (sitting on the inside of a booth) and talking with the person next to you. I’m clearly dozing off and not paying attention to 
  your boring conversation, so you tell me to go get you a beer. And, perhaps without even realizing that it’s not my own idea, I get up 
  and order the beer you want and bring it back to the table. As long as we’ve already agreed that this sort of reasonable, respectful, 
  limited use of body, mind and time is alright, this seems like a fine thing to be capable of sharing with other conscious embodiments. 
  While that level of technology may be a ways off, the definition of collective consciousness I have in mind is already possible. We 
  simply have to universalize our current technologies — smartphones with ubiquitous internet access. By definition, for humanity to be 
  collectively conscious along the technological axis, the internet must exist, and everyone must have access to it at all times, should 
  they so chose to connect. With that as a first goal, newer iterations can be developed and rolled out as we create them.
</p>
<p>
  While we are somewhat close to achieving this definition of collective consciousness technologically, our advances along the insight 
  access are relatively less pronounced. Insight toward collective consciousness deals particularly with the awareness of humans and 
  humanity. This includes our individual understanding of humanity, humanity’s understanding of each of us as individuals and the 
  understanding that humanity’s collective consciousness has of itself. Already today, the internet provides individuals with a 
  sufficiently thorough understanding of the world and of what’s going on generally with most of humanity. However, it does not follow 
  that those individuals draw the same conclusions given this apparently uniform access to knowledge. Still, when provided internet 
  access, each such individual meets the technical definition presented for collective consciousness given today's technology. The 
  awareness humanity has of itself is far more limited. Even given the general awareness the internet allows individuals to glean about 
  the global state of humanity, there are so many people without internet access that most of the possible individual to individual human 
  connections are impossible to make. And in order for the collective to be aware of the individuals, individuals would need a means of 
  identifying and expressing themselves to whatever extent they choose. In this sense, humanity’s collective consciousness largely lacks 
  even the ability to be aware of itself.
</p>
<p>
  Further, the disagreement and uncertainty present within and among individuals lacks a consistent presentation. In order for a human 
  collective consciousness to gain the required insight of itself, this sort of presentation must exist. I previously mentioned the idea 
  of a consensus function, which is one rudimentary form that humanity’s collective consciousness could take. Alternatively, or 
  additionally, the example of a meaningful open forum, like that of Ender’s game would suffice to be a consensus function if the forum’s 
  content directly impacted the governing decisions made at a global level. Indeed this would also require a governing body with authority 
  to enforce certain decisions to be implemented globally.
</p>
<p>
  Global governing structures are an example of the coordination required for humanity to be considered collectively conscious. To some 
  extent this level of organization already exists in entities such as INTERPOL, the United Nations and international courts. Yet, these 
  organizations’ abilities fall short of meeting the level of coordination required to tackle some seemingly obvious problems. As an 
  aside, global climate control is a great example. The problem is that global warming is considered a political issue rather than a 
  scientific one. The result is that despite overwhelming evidence and expert consensus, our leaders have been allowed to delay action in 
  accord with undue influence from non-scientific constituencies. And while there is no guarantee that a different system, which allows us 
  to more effectively address issues with global climate, will also be better for humanity overall, it is clearly possible. And given the 
  potential downsides of failing to address such issues, experimentation in an attempt to identify a better overall system is warranted. 
  So while technically, we have met the rudimentary definition of global coordination by operating some authoritative international 
  organizations, there is plenty of room for improvement. There is little doubt that this will happen, and plenty of reason to advocate 
  for great caution in our experimental progression toward such ends.
</p>
<p>
  As humanity progresses along the various axes, we may expect our understanding and definition of collective consciousness to transform 
  with ourselves and the universe we inhabit. At times the changes may be quicker or slower, yet change is ever present. Let’s imagine the 
  changes possible now and how they lead us toward a vision of collective consciousness more or less like the one I presented earlier.
</p>
<h4>Next Steps</h4>
<p>
  Unlike the way that handheld computers became commonplace over the course of a generation, Living a collectively conscious lifestyle 
  will have a much longer adoption period. While the benefits of sharing the world’s raw knowledge are immediate and one-sided, the 
  benefit of sharing life experiences, trust in our neighbors and even use of our bodies only works when the group members have some level 
  of alignment. There are potential drawbacks; it’s not a obvious, mutually beneficial transformation. At the same time, it is clearly a 
  gain in specific contexts. For example, if you could play a team game and have the ability to take over for other players at opportune 
  moments based on your knowledge and their position, you’d have an advantage over the opposing team if they cannot do the same. While we 
  assume that at a high level of play, teams already work together quite seamlessly, one would still expect a more collectively 
  consciousness style of play to outperform the traditional group of individuals, given a comparable level of skill. Thankfully, the 
  technology allowing that sort of advanced behavior of collective consciousness will itself be potentially slow to arrive.
</p>
<p>
  More quickly, we can build and advocate for some of the previously mentioned features of a rudimentary collective consciousness: 
  ubiquitous internet, universal access to smartphones, a consensus function and a meaningful open forum for prioritizing human goals. 
  Furthermore, it’s possible and probably recommended that we implement collective consciousness first locally, rather than globally. This 
  gives us the ability to experiment on the implementation of our technologies and perfect their ability to improve and augment our 
  current systems’ means of providing coordination and insight. So finally, let’s start designing an implementation of a consensus 
  function. We can build the forum and the consensus function today. What do I want it to be? What do we want it to be? I have my guesses. 
  What do you want it to be? Do I even know you?
</p>
<p>
  I want everyone to be able to express themselves openly, should they so choose, to share who they are and what they want, and for <b>all 
  of that</b> to be taken into account in a known and well defined manner during the policy implementation process. I want to make 
  politicians obsolete because everyone is a politician by default when we want to be. I want to be able to know what everyone else thinks 
  is important, not just the people on television; I want it in aggregate and in specific. I want to vote directly on everything, should I 
  so choose. I want more of the influence that direct democracy promises and that technology will provide. I want to know when the system 
  is broken because humans say it is. Where’s the poll for that?
</p>
<p>
  This new system looks like a ballot box that’s always open, on steroids. It starts with who we are, as individuals and as groups, 
  organizations, collectives, communities, etc. In the governmental sense, the city needs to know who its residents are without those 
  residents living in fear of the government. This goes outside of the technology implementation and requires additional legislative 
  safeguards that protect individuals from prosecution as any result of participating in their own governance. The technology obviously 
  needs to be secure and protect privacy, yet the government must be forced to respect that privacy if and when it’s technologically 
  impossible to implement safeguards. Next, citizens need to be able to share whatever opinions they have about anything, openly. Finally, 
  the technology must be constantly updated to use the opinions provided to directly influence any and all governmental decision making 
  processes.
</p>
<p>
  Let’s say an existing or upstart political party decided to implement a rudimentary system for identity, opinion sharing and consensus-
  style decision making via a well defined algorithm. What might the implications for an imaginary city of today look like where that 
  party controls the entire legislative process? Picture Quasitopia, a mythical experiment in the early days of consensus function 
  experimentation. For the most part, Quasitopia, which everyone calls Pia, looks like any other city in the region. The first major 
  difference is that Pia’s residents receive notifications, tailored to their individual interests, when the government is working on a 
  project. The second major difference is that all of the projects the government works on come from an analysis of what residents 
  concerns are. These concerns set goals for the city, like “eliminate homelessness, provide clean water, establish clean transportation 
  infrastructure or alter the wealth distribution.” Analysis of the resident’s desires prioritizes the goals. The budget determines the 
  amount of goals that can be addressed. This is all quite similar to how things work now, except that consensus between competing 
  interests is resolved strictly by the public debate rather than by the quasi-public debate of other cities’ representatives. In fact, 
  while Pia still has representatives, they talk to each other in the same forums as the residents talk to each other. They are virtually 
  indistinguishable, except that their votes count for a bit more, as they are the fallback for people without another established means 
  of voting.
</p>
<p>
  If the resulting city is so similar to the way we already do things, is it really worth implementing? The only way to know is to test it 
  out.

    Decision-Making in Context and across Contexts

<p>
  One creates nested default groups to make moral judgements and decisions. These groups become the contexts in which to apply principles 
  or analysis to decide, and the final decisions comes from the group which wins when its contextual relevance is given supremacy. For 
  example, if we discuss whether to kill someone is wrong, the universal contextual answer is, "It is wrong." Or perhaps, the universal 
  answer is unknown or is both right and wrong together, and the context of an environment filled with humans, the context of humanity, 
  makes killing wrong. Looking further inward, killing in accordance with the death penalty is right, if we accept that laws are the 
  societally accepted moral framework relevant in a given time and place. If the individual executioner has inside knowledge about the 
  inmate's innocence which was known to be excluded from the legal process, the killing becomes wrong again. So, how does the executioner 
  make the decision.
</p>
<p>
  The spectrum of default groups must reach from the context of the individual to that of the universe. In between the two extremes, there 
  are several natural intermediates: earth, life, animal life, humanity, jurisdictions of law, companies, families, tribes, etc. The time-
  limited process of making a decision must be imperfect.

  My nails dug into the soft rubber of the steering wheel as I leaned forward and pressed firmly on the accelerator. They had passed us, 
  and the immediate surge of anger and humiliation ratcheted my competitive drive into top gear. Without thinking, I moved over into the 
  lane of oncoming traffic as we climbed up the steep hill. They couldn’t see it coming. We were regaining the lead.
</p>
<p>
  They slowed to a halt, jumped out and ran over to us.
</p>
<p>
  As it turned out, I was the one that couldn’t see it coming. And with nowhere to go, the innocent non-combatant crested the hill in line 
  with our path to victory, wiping it away in a head-on (injury-free) collision.
</p>
<p>
  Growing up I learned the wisdom of better safe than sorry. Even if forgotten at times, the phrase was a constant reminder. Contrast that 
  to the lifestyle of today’s emboldened youth, the YOLO generation, and it’s hard to imaging the implications. Oddly, it’s not our youth, 
  but rather our elders plotting a dangerous one-shot trajectory for our nation, and the world. Their paralleled nonchalance (everyone 
  errs) impedes our country’s efforts to lead, to confront the subversive, mounting catastrophe of environmental neglect.
</p>
<p>
  Even if you wanted to doubt the existence of global warming or its causes, you have to be reckless to ignore the threat it presents. And 
  yeah, the metaphor breaks down. This is everyone’s first experience with manipulating the environment on a global scale. We are just 
  learning the rules of the road, even as we drive for the first time. But, let’s not claim an excuse to act like children.
</p>
<p>
  We know that this is new. The newness gave us our doubts in the first place.
</p>
<p>
  Maturity and experience suggest we proceed with caution. If you think you see an oncoming car, you slow down. Now we know you old folks 
  like to have fun too, but let’s take our foot of the gas this time. Better safe than sorry.

  <em>2016-11-06</em>
</h3>
<p>
  I often wonder what others would think about various thought experiments I run in my head. In particular, how would the various 
  potential futures I contemplate rank in terms of desirability. Given that each of our ideal futures has a unique composition of 
  features, what would be some of the common trends? Could we agree on any goals at all? And if not, could we agree on a process for 
  determining the goals even if we can't all agree on what they are? There are so many people that don't even speak the same languages 
  that I do; what do they want? Where do we agree and disagree?
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, I'm curious about the prospect of global visions for humanity, rather than today's focus on the meager expression and 
  internal agreement in nation-states. While there is clear, if ineffectual process for guiding nations, the international community's 
  process is certainly less developed. In considering potential futures on this scale, it strikes me that I find some of them very 
  displeasurable.

  Specks of light dotting the night sky gleamed meagerly in the distance. As the cool artificial breeze of the Martian domes brushed 
  gently against Kaiya's cheeks, she couldn't help but wonder what became of her grandmother's friend's grandchildren. Her Terran peers' 
  parents lost the technology for communicating with the colony Mars over two decades ago now. As the population surpassed one million in 
  2081, just a few years ago, the celebration was bittersweet, unshared with so many friends from humanity's home world.
</p>
<p>
  ***
</p>
<p>
  Do others fear cataclysmic rifts in our species as I do? The Martian example is particularly illustrative for its physical divide, but 
  techno-socioeconomic partitions scare me just as much.
</p>
<p>
  Already, we see segregated communities around the globe - in the Arab States, Nigeria and the United States and elsewhere - stratified 
  greatly along economic lines. When groups with money tend to see positively reinforcing feedback loops that grant them privilege to 
  compounding gains, they stand positioned to run away with our global civilization's power and control. Even now, elites often control 
  laws or have the money to evade them. The top tier of human society stands apart from the rest.
</p>
<p>
  Technology also feeds into the feedback loops. Technology can be adopted first by elites. They know about it first, and they can afford 
  it. If technology Z is build on Y which is built on X and so on, and if an elite group gains access to Z before anyone outside the group 
  has access to A, it may well be fair to say that the elite group has sufficiently separated itself from the rest of humanity. The 
  specific technology could further reinforce this idea. For example, genetic control of our offspring down to the level of individual 
  base pairs and epigenetic fingerprinting would be a game changer in terms of our evolution as a species. Evolved intelligence where 
  humans are integrated with AI in a manner that gives some individuals orders of magnitude more cognitive processing power might also 
  render the unprivileged people powerless and obsolete.
</p>
<p>
  If we really care about human inclusion, equality and the value of individual human lives, we soon must contemplate the implications of 
  technology, resource distribution and economic stratification on the development of our species. Extrapolating backwards the idea of 
  inclusivity in the face of such major technological progress of our potential future, are we in the right place today? While I think we 
  are still largely okay - it's been less than a generation since cell phones and the internet became common - I do worry about the next 
  generation. What if 10% of the world is still without cellphones in 2030? That would mean that many children in developed nations have 
  parents that grew up with cell phones while 1 of every 10 humans couldn't even get one then.
</p>
<p>
  More broadly though, my question is about whether or not we are, as a species, simply alright with that prospect. Do we even care? If we 
  have 9 billion people and the top 7 billion don't really notice when the bottom 2 billion suffer, why would we change? And if the top 10 
  million can simply ignore or even subjugate the rest of the 9 billion, would there be enough impetus within the elites to prevent it? If 
  your children are part of the future mainstream, if you are, do you care?

  <em>2016-11-03</em>
</h3>
<p>
  I'm Grant Robert Smith. I'm Zyzzyx of Nal. Actually, that's an alter ego name that I use internally in several ways. Nal is sort of like 
  my word for God. It's a portmanteau of nothing and all - the combination of opposites into a single foundational concept that underpins 
  my conception of the universe. You could take and restate Nal however you like, which is kind of what I think of when you look at the 
  myriad conceptions that individuals have of the notion of God. For me, it commonly appears as 'Doubt everything except and including 
  this.' Or, 'We know nothing for certain, and this we certainly know.' It is the juxtaposition or combination of nothing and everything, 
  doubt and certainty, whatever you want.
</p>
<p>
  Ok, you may be thinking, "That's nice, but it's kind of not saying anything at all." To which I would respond that this is precisely the 
  point. Because on top of this foundational concept (or without or next to or however you prefer), you can build the rest of your 
  conception of reality. For better or worse, our existence seems to have a decent amount of consistency to it, which leads mostly to 
  conceptions mirroring the universe itself. "Cogito ergo sum," as Descartes put it. And then you have science or fantasy. You have fate or 
  free will. You have chaos or morality. These are inclusive 'or's and not intended as opposites. Build a worldview however you like, but 
  be warned that you may not like the world you view.
</p>
<p>
  How I do it
</p>
<p>
  Balance. More specifically, I think of balancing truth and positivity. That consistency of experience I mentioned before comes in use for 
  our small and limited minds. The fact that we can make predictions based on past experience and causal relationships is quite nice. So, I 
  hold the truth in high regard. While you observe a rock hurdling toward you, it might feel nice - for a bit - to have the unshakable 
  belief that 'the rock will be stopped by your mind powers, and that it will fall to the ground before it strikes your face.' This sort of 
  positivity is almost certainly unwarranted. Here, the physical reality is simple and predictable to a degree that positivity should play 
  no part in the matter. On the other hand, positivity is great when reasonable doubt enters the picture. The unshakable belief that 'I 
  will have a pleasant interaction when I go up and talk to a stranger' is hence more reasonable. Obviously, it's not going to be true 100% 
  of the time, but it's still reasonable. It's reasonable because it's going to be true some of the time and because the potential harms of 
  its falseness are negligible.
</p>
<p>
  While this is a simple and reasonable place to start, it's not much of a worldview yet. Truth alone is enough to create most of my view 
  on the world since I exist not in a vacuum but in an observable space. I hope I'm quoting my friend Shane Golden correctly as saying, "I 
  am, now, in this place." Or, incorporating my brother's idea of 'mutually shared experience,' one could rephrase it as, "We are, here, 
  now." This is the basic acceptance of a shared universe with consistency across local observation of space and time. Truth begets 
  physicalism which begets science which begets more truth, and it appears trivial to simply accept the majority of that which is and of 
  that which you hear and see and feel and smell and so on and so on. I even largely extend this acceptance of truth to that which I read 
  and that which people tell me, so long as it's consistent. And, even when inconsistencies arise, it's easy enough to take Occam's Razor 
  approach, the simplest explanation, assuming best intentions and greatest positivity when explanations are comparably simple.
</p>
<p>
  Good intentions and positivity only seem to matter when I start adding the key ingredient - meaning - to existence. The choice to give 
  meaning to existence is logically arbitrary, but almost universally intrinsic in the context of existing in the first place. If I think I 
  am, here, now, in this place without meaning, I can logically justify anything. I can subsequently create meaning in a bubble surrounded 
  by meaninglessness and derive whatever moral framework I want. To some extent, we all do this. It's necessary because we have limited 
  capacity. We can only process so much information, and we can only observe so much of the universe. But, anytime we make an arbitrary 
  bubble without ever thinking about it's context or questioning it, we risk losing our connection with the truth. In turn, we lose true 
  consistency between the universe and our conception thereof. It will still appear to be consistent because the inconstancy is covered in 
  meaninglessness, hidden outside the bubble of meaning we have defined for ourselves. But the truth and our inconsistency are there, 
  lurking in the meaninglessness beyond our bubble of spatiotemporal relevancy.
</p>
<p>
  Instead, I choose meaning, always. Plus, meaning just feels better than meaningless. It seems like a nicely balanced take on truth and 
  positivity. And with meaning, comes morality. Actually, morality requires there to be context and for that context to include other human 
  beings or comparably intelligent forms with which to interact and reason about morality. But since that's pretty much a given, we all 
  have morality in some sense, even if we don't always recognize it as such, especially in others. I'd guess most people define their 
  personal worldview and morality from the inside out, from where they're positioned in the universe. I do this too, and at the same time, 
  I define it from the outside in. What do things look like for the entirety of the universe? Obviously the answer is beyond my capacity, 
  but it's an important question for me in defining my morality. I do my best to take into account all possible context, from where we come 
  and to where we will go. Personally, this thought process comes from a place of decision making. My morality stems from trying to decide 
  how to spend my time and what to do with my life.
</p>
<p>
  In making decisions, I started with what I felt like are the biggest ones. The things that an individual chooses with greatest impact on 
  the universe are what to do with your life's work and wether to have children (since it's going to be a big part of someone's life to 
  raise that child). Because children additionally have a propagating effect of potentially creating more children, that decision seems to 
  have a high chance of being more impactful on the universe over time than even what to do with one's life's work. So first, I decided not 
  to have children. We have enough people for the planet; if I want to raise children, I'll adopt. Plus, humans are evolving faster based 
  on technology than biology, so it's not like genetic propagation matters much. Second, I decided what to do in the 60 or so years I had 
  left to live. This turned out to be a much more difficult decision making process. Apparently I started with the same question as Elon 
  Musk ("What will most affect the future of humanity?"), but I was trying to pin it down to a single answer rather than a list of topics.
</p>
<p>
  I guess as a side note, the rest of my morality, like how to treat people and what laws should be and all that "simple" stuff is taken on 
  a case by case basis within the context of where I want humanity to go with itself in the future. I'll get back to this later because in 
  deciding what to do with my life, I ended up coming up first with a framework for combining goals and desires with inevitabilities and 
  physical trends. This in turn led to a method for deciding what laws should be. And, the remainder comes from evaluating the local 
  context from the inside out (e.i. being nice to people around you) and from balancing contexts against one another based on the 
  consequences.

  <blockquote>
    "I have advice for people who want to write. I don’t care whether they’re 5 or 500. There are three things that are important: First, 
    if you want to write, you need to keep an honest, unpublishable journal that nobody reads, nobody but you. Where you just put down what 
    you think about life, what you think about things, what you think is fair and what you think is unfair. And second, you need to read. 
    You can’t be a writer if you’re not a reader. It’s the great writers who teach us how to write. The third thing is to write. Just write 
    a little bit every day. Even if it’s for only half an hour — write, write, write."
  </blockquote>
  <em>— Madaleine L'Engle</em>
</p>
<p>
  I was chatting with my friend QuHarrison Terry about his creative process for writing last week, and the theme of repetition - as 
  presented in L'Engle's third point - resonated throughout our conversation. While typically difficult for those unaccustomed to it, even 
  writing and rewriting the same idea over and over helps. As a perfectionist, I usually try to get it exactly right the first time. When 
  I'm writing, this means editing in place over and over as I try to achieve an impossible goal. I remember being taught in school to work 
  in drafts, and it always annoyed me. But coming back to writing as free-time activity in my adult life, I can see how getting the ideas 
  out is more important than perfecting the phrasing surrounding them.
</p>
<p>
  Transitioning from one idea to another is also a struggle. I would guess that the overall flow of the ideas throughout the work is more 
  important than the phrasing of transitions, so similar to the way in which spitting things onto the page beats chewing them up in your 
  head, having an outline to guide the flow of the paper is superior to working through all the transitions as they enter your flow.
</p>
<p>
  The next thing I want to touch on is L'Engle's first point. It's about practice and repetition much like the third, but it's also about 
  diversifying your topics, discovering your interests and developing your voice as a writer. (As an aside, the privacy portion is 
  something I personally would like to think is unnecessary, which is why this blog would make no sense to someone finding it organically 
  on the internet.) In the talk with Qu, I related this to his notion of author authenticity. If you're going to publish something for 
  others to consume, it should at least speak to you. It should be something you're interested in and can get behind and support and defend 
  in the case where you have a discussion with someone about what you put out there. I don't think this means that you have to have such a 
  discussion, just that you'd enjoy it if you were to have it, and that you'd genuinely believe in what you were saying during the 
  conversation in the same way you believe in your original work.
</p>
<p>
  L'Engle's remaining point about reading is the one I'm least certain of. While I think reading helps your vocabulary, reading 
  generically, reading for content, doesn't cut it. In order for reading to significantly impact your writing, I think you have to be 
  reading <b>with that in mind</b>. You have to be focusing on critically evaluating the author's style. You have to be thinking about how 
  different types of content lend themselves to different types of prose. A fantasy novel would be ruined by the terse nature of the prose 
  you find in scientific journals. <em>Jason approached the cliff at 4.5 m/s and extended his arm with hand outstretched, adding an 
  additional 17 cm to his reach as he caught the falling red Farlax just half a meter from the cliff's edge</em>. Reading contributes most 
  toward improving your writing when you're looking for the things you like in the author's work. For example, in writing fiction, which I 
  rarely do, I find that my setup is often lacking and my descriptive prose, imperative to setting a scene, is frequently imbalanced 
  against the scene's action. So, I might read a few of my favorite sci-fi authors to see how they do it.

  I feel like I grew up completely disempowered to pursue people romantically. It's ironic given the standard cultural problem is boys

  To some extent I really don't know how to help the people who are the worst off in society. the ones who are unintelligent, unattractive 
  and poor. the ones who have mental illnesses that prevent them from participating. I think real help for people in this space would be 
  focusing on their enjoyment of life in addition to their generic well-being and maintenance. (Think assembly line or qc work for 
  physically and mentally handicapped individuals.) We could always have government create jobs that aren’t economically viable but that 
  make the world a better place. Things like cleaning the outside or manual OCR. Ask people to do them for low hours but reasonable pay. To 
  all the anti-intellectual's out there (especially in the group that is technomically incapable), I don't really know what to say. I'm 
  sorry. And we really need your help too, even though you disagree with us. The best we can do is include these people in a conversation 
  and listen to them. The only thing we really can’t do is let idiocracy become a reality, which I don’t think is a serious concern, but it 
  should be studied more. When would it become a serious concern, if ever? Also, if give these people well-being and enjoyment in life, I 
  think they will just stay out of the way. Non-child enjoyment can probably be incentivized.

    A Call to Experiment with Economic Models

</h3>
<p>
  MLK's 'I Have a Dream' speech still rings true today in many ways. Clearly for the black community in the United States, police 
  brutality, social segregation and institutionalized poverty are still relevant issues. And for this, we all suffer: blacks, whites, 
  Latinos, and all Americans. We suffer together. Injustice continues to oppress our nation. Poverty continues to shackle our brothers and 
  sisters, our fellow Americans. Each day, millions of Americans miss out on their "inalienable Rights" to "Life, Liberty and the pursuit 
  of Happiness." And so as the great Dr. MLK said, "We cannot be satisfied... We cannot be satisfied as long as the [poor man's] basic 
  mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one." We cannot be satisfied so long as the institution of poverty unjustly detains even 
  one of our fellow Americans.
</p>
<p>
  While the task is obvious, we have too long toiled in defining success. If it is self-evident that "all men are created equal," let us 
  aim for freedom from generational transfer of poverty. Let the poor man's son grow up with the rich man's daughter, the rich man's son 
  with the poor man's daughter. Arm in arm they we must let all our children seek in fairness and truth the life, liberty and happiness 
  this nation promises them.
</p>
<p>
  Success is an equal outcome for rich and poor alike. Success is a simple and just tax system. Success is elimination of poverty, 
  homelessness, and joblessness.
</p>
<p>
  Success is solving poverty. Most simply, poverty is solved with a minimum income tied to cost of living. Because cost of living is tied 
  to location, this means that if the government maintains that its citizens have the freedom to chose where they live, migratory trends 
  will impact the cost. In order to achieve the basic level of human rights considered to be universal, this income should cover healthy 
  food, clean water, basic heating, clothing, housing, healthcare and the needs of any children. Children need education, in addition to 
  the basic needs described above. All of these expenses entail a significant tax burden on the working population. Obviously, if too many 
  people are unemployed, this system fails.
</p>
<p>
  Solving poverty is the first real step on the path to global collaboration. Certainly if we have people struggling to subsist, they will 
  be even further incapable of collaborating meaningfully to the progress of our global society. And without meaningful participation in 
  our global society, they lack meaning to it, must fail to derive truth from it. They would be reasonable and right to lack trust in it. 
  Moving forward into a shared truth, a cultivated trust and a collaborative process is, first and foremost, the same as creating a society 
  free from poverty.
</p>
<p>
  How do we liberate ourselves of destitution? There are many solutions we might test. For one, despite having existed as a societal 
  species for thousands of years, we have yet to thoroughly test the successful hypothesis of minimum income: society free from poverty. 
  Oddly, government has restricted information on the one real experiment - Mincome, performed by Canada in the 1970s. Recent attempts in 
  Finland and Switzerland to test the idea more broadly have been rejected by the public.
</p>
<p>
  Even if such an unchecked mincome arrangement were to fail at a local or national level, compromises may also be tested. Perhaps the 
  government only pledges a subset of the universal basic rights. The right to children alone threatens to bloat the cost of social 
  services immensely. Nixing that single provision might well be sufficient to balance the entire system of rights.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively, requiring people to work might add the productivity required to balance the system. Educating the citizenry to the level 
  required for individual productivity may challenge the system in this case. If people cannot do the jobs available at the precipice of 
  societies productive progress, forcing people to work will negligibly or detrimentally impact the system's overall output. In developed 
  countries today, this is already a problem as many well-paying positions with intense prerequisite knowledge and/or experience go 
  unfilled.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, it remains unclear whether all people possess the physical and biological capacity to productively participate in cases 
  where all such jobs require high levels of technical expertise. For example, there is some initial evidence that certain people lack the 
  capacity to learn computer programming. Time will tell the extent to which this challenge exists and persists, if at all. However, if 
  more people challenge society to accommodate them, the slower society will progress.
</p>
<p>
  People and the environment together form the system which sustains and enriches us. So similarly, the environment challenges progress in 
  several ways. Resource limitations impose a concrete boundary to the system. Because the energy available comes almost entirely from the 
  sun, we know the maximum capacity at which the entire system operates.
</p>
<p>
  Knowing these limitations actually frees us to design and test different societal and technological arrangements. Without the 
  understanding of how the universe and how humanity operate, the blind assumption must be that anything is possible. We would never know 
  where to start. Given the truth surrounding the challenges to the systems in which we exist, we can finally begin to progress in a guided 
  and methodical fashion, rather than by the chance nature of our stochastic biology.
</p>
<p>
  Only with a shared understanding of these systems can we build trust among ourselves. For this reason, understanding, accepting and 
  establishing standards for agreeing upon the nature of the universe with which decisions are made and actions taken is crucial. 
  Reasonable doubt is important, and for the save of robustness and diversity within the system, doubt should be tolerated to the extent 
  that it remains unthreatening to the system's sustainability and progression. Utter rejection of basic principals that threaten the 
  system itself must be reasonably contained.
</p>
<p>
  Especially in the transition to a global society, knowing the limitations may yet be insufficient to provide for the security and 
  well-being within any region, nation-state, or local civilization. Unless a subset of society can balance the global impacts of the 
  remaining humans, the external portion of humanity will always threaten the maintenance and progression of any and all subsets. Even when 
  completely isolated economically, they share their environment.
</p>
<p>
  Collaboration therefore facilitates addressing global environmental challenges. At minimum, an isolated nation would require information 
  regarding the external behavior of the remaining society to predict and address its impacts on their environment. Beyond facilitating 
  solutions, collaboration is almost required, as the alternative, proved surveillance, seems likely to activate the vicious cycle of 
  reducing trust, increasing external information protection and increasingly invasive surveillance.
</p>
<p>
  A similar virtuous cycle, increasing collaboration and trust simultaneously, paves the road to facilitating global problem solving. This 
  makes building trust between and among nations just as important as the raw collaboration. And while collaboration between individuals or 
  states may increase trust, the interaction between citizens and their governments is far less obvious. Trust within nations seems instead 
  to be derived from prosperity and wealth distribution. Extending this result to the global society suggests that in a stagnating global 
  economy, only a globally equitable wealth distribution is capable of maintaining the trust required to facilitated maintenance and 
  progress of a global society in the face of passive adversity. (Active adversity, such as an external invader, in itself elicits 
  cooperation among distinct, mutually threatened groups.)
</p>
<p>
  Logically, fairness, including equitable wealth distribution is required for trust. Wealth distribution is determined by social and 
  economic policy and people determine policy. If the system is unfair and produces an unfair distribution of resources, I must ultimately 
  fault people. People control the government by participating in it or by being accepting of it. Some of those people have high levels of 
  influence over the system, others little, and because all people have some level of influence over the system, eventually, the system's 
  unfairness will breed distrust among the people.
</p>
<p>
  Still, equitable wealth distribution is insufficient alone to produce trust. There must be a cultural component as well, such that the 
  rest of the system is perceived as fair. In fact this culture can broaden the wealth distribution curves that are perceived as equitable. 
  In essence, trust must exist and cannot be simply or easily injected into an untrusting society. The transition is eased by equitable 
  resource distribution, good governance, fairness and other social factors, but the generational and learned inmates trust can be 
  strengthened independently of other influences in individuals that chose to trust first. In fact it is the leap of faith to trust first 
  that seems to make interaction building possible at all.
</p>
<p>
  So long as the flame of trust burns, it brightens the future for all.
</p>
<p>
  Even in the light of trust, with strong collaboration among people and nations, false truth can undermine a society's ability to deal 
  with adversity. While individual doubt is healthy and required, societal action must be reasonably permitted, and individuals must be 
  forgiving of the actions flying in the face of their personal doubt. And in time, we must assume that our doubts and mistruths will be 
  resolved in accordance with the universe. To some extent, it is even required that we trust the universe that the resolution process is 
  amicable or at least acceptable. This is just as true for nations and societies as it is for individuals.
</p>
<p>
  When assessing different solutions for the system in its entirety, we need to allow and encourage testing of such solutions. Thorough 
  tests are nearly or completely impossible to conduct. Still, small scale approximations that work well can and should have an accepted 
  process for scaling up to change even the outermost level of organization. Proposing San Francisco, California as a test bed for 
  unrestricted Mincome, we might easily run a thought experiment first to generate our hypothesis.
</p>
<p>
  San Francisco is a popular place to live. Additionally, it has some strong physical limits imposed by the landscape, being surrounded by 
  water on three sides. Already, we know this causes problems with space availability as reflected in the housing market. So, we can 
  easily expect a naive, unrestricted Mincome implementation to fail because no amount of money would allow the people that want to live 
  there to find housing. There is no more housing to find. Even if we allow them to build housing, serious cost and space concerns arise.
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, if San Francisco is allowed to prevent immigration locally, much as the Galápagos Islands restrict travel, the 
  thought experiment would likely result in a provocative success. Either the city could remove the existing homeless population and 
  prevent their reentry, or they could subsidize away the problem for the existing population and prevent further immigration. This 
  solution removes freedom of travel, making it more comparable to a global implementation of minimum income because immigration to Earth 
  doesn't exist.

<p>
  While there is at least one fundamental inconsistency within the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDoHR) as it’s written, it pretty 
  well covers what we hope a mature human civilization would provide to every member therein, should they choose to take it (a caveat I’ll 
  return to later). At the same time, everything in the declaration is basically a service in one form or another and all services require 
  money to provide. Therefore in practice, various nations are able to implement the UDoHR to different degrees and with different 
  strategies and challenges to their implementations.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe take a more in depth look at some example countries, so on and so forth (not just the ones that are close to UDoHR from a Western 
  sense, but also maybe Saudi Arabia, Italy, China, Singapore and Somalia).

  Stepping out of the box, let’s look at how the Universe restricts its shape and one way we might go about trying to implement as many of

  <a href="https://grantsmithblog.blogspot.com/2016/10/balancing-truth-and-positivity.html">Balancing Truth and Positivity</a> - 
  <em>2016-10-19</em>
</h3>
<p>
  Balancing truth and positivity is a fundamental aspect of my personal philosophy. It underpins many of my morals, goals, feelings, 
  thoughts and actions. And while it's certainly not a religion, it is my religion or at least an important component thereof. To the 
  extent that every person, organization or group, be it formal or informal, has religion, as in a unique set of guiding principles, from 
  my vantage point, it appears far more common to greater emphasize positivity than to emphasize truth. An inconvenient truth is aptly 
  named for this reason, but global climate change is not the only topic appropriate for that title. Maybe I'd go on to talk about the 
  *socioeconomic struggle* of middle class Europeans, Japanese and Americans in the face of globalization, or overpopulation, or peak oil, 
  or the *potential obsolescence of human labor* and the plethora of *out of work* or unemployed individuals. But what we really need to 
  talk about is how we got to this place of inconvenient truths and how we might yet walk away with scars that fade instead of amputated 
  limbs and *traumatic memory loss* or PTSD (motivated forgetting on Wikipedia).
</p>
<p>
  Our positivity today exists in the context of our past and our conception thereof. Modern cultural understanding comes from a long 
  history of American success over the past 100 years. Perception of human history, dating back centuries and millennia, further 
  reinforces modern attitudes. Schooling, entertainment and almost every other exposure to history focuses on the impressive, the 
  eventful, the progressive and the majestic. Since these times are long gone, we package most historical events together in our minds. We 
  lose perspective on the immense amount of time it took to arrive at our present condition. In reality, civilizations rose and fell 
  across the planet over the course of several thousand years. There were periods of progress and periods of stagnation and periods of 
  regression. Societal and economic growth only happen sometimes. We seem to have forgotten this recently.
</p>
<p>
  Or, rather than, forget the normalcy of economic stagnation and stability, perhaps we lack the education. Living in times of growth and 
  prosperity for generations, we learned to expect it. America has been a global superpower for about 150 years now. The industrial 
  revolution ratcheted a territorial expansion (robbery of natives’ land) and population growth into previously unfathomable demographic 
  transformation. Cities became the size of empires and with more people and more technological experimentation, the acceleration of 
  breakthrough after breakthrough begun over a century ago continues today. Again we lose context; we focus on globalization’s novelty, 
  rather than the typicality of temporary expansion followed by long, steady lulls.
</p>
<p>
  Globalization has brought amazing magnitude and interconnectedness to our growth. At the same time, we’ve moved at different rates, 
  leaving many groups stratified and siloed. Importantly, the groups with greatest influence and power have retained their positivity with 
  their fame, money and success. As an investment banker, programmer, doctor, CEO or any one of so many profitable roles in society, the 
  positivity comes as expected, token, unsurprising. We in the United States miss the mobility required to balance the past’s optimism with 
  the troubling realities of the present. The diversity of opinion reflective of the true state of affairs percolates slowly into the minds 
  of society’s rich leaders and isolated academics.
</p>
<p>
  These societal organization issues thrive also because of our individual biases. In its difficulty, fighting the innate drive of our 
  nature parallels knowing what we have yet to learn. Even after the truth presents itself to our face, *we want to reject it*. Sometimes, 
  personal motives make the desire to deny the truth even worse. As a widely accepted example, take the tobacco industry’s denial of 
  cigarette’s link to cancer. At first, I’m sure the business leaders simply wanted to refuse the results because human nature drove them 
  to favor hope over truth. After tests confirmed the results, however, the fault shifts to their conscious decision making process. What 
  started in their biology was reinforced by their desire to make money, and rejection of fact cemented in their brains. In the worst case, 
  the untruth is a neurological parasite that spreads to infect other hosts. If they too are predisposed to lie because of their 
  incentives, similar complications continue to cause verbal vomit and allow the parasite to continue its lifecycle. Even when the issue 
  is less contagious, hidden only by human nature, it threatens to grow on it’s own. Unfortunately, we as a society make these dangerous 
  subjects commonplace by allowing positivity to outweigh truth.
</p>
<p>
  Any number of inconvenient subjects important to our future avoid meaningful discussion. The most challenging ones endanger our very 
  existence.
</p>
<p>
  Bringing balance back to our positivity is a challenge we can and must pass. Thankfully, we posses several tools suited to this 
  undertaking. We can focus on evidence-based policy. We can run more frequent experiments to test policy initiatives. We can give 
  experts more authority when our external environment challenges us. We can recommit to inclusive politics, where all voices are heard 
  and valued. A combination of all these strategies will give the best chance of balancing truth and positivity in America and throughout 
  the world.
</p>
<p>
  It’s true that humans have optimistic goals. We have policy for the sake of reaching these goals. For example, when we wanted to go to 
  the moon, we created a space program. When we want to reduce homelessness, we alter zoning and economic policies to spur development and 
  job growth. Yet, the goals rarely exist in the written policy itself. By pursuing goal oriented legislation, we hold ourselves more 
  accountable to our history of goal achievement. Goal oriented legislation prevents us from hiding or forgetting failures to meet goals 
  and deadlines. It creates a framework for evidence based policy and experimentation, and it makes the truth more plain.
</p>
<p>
  Experimenting with policy implementation and using the results as evidence for altering our policies and platforms will help us find the 
  downsides we miss in our organic social organization. While ideas for goals, metrics, prioritization and experiments should come from 
  the people, evidence and experimental results should inform the policies based on those ideas. While higher levels of government 
  sometimes use lower levels to experiment with various social policy implementations, cities could be leveraged far more as proving 
  grounds. In this way, even if the state or federal government is divided, experiments can be designed to test a proposed policy from 
  either side. Suburban or rural communities could similarly be used as test subjects for new policies. In this way, social ills and 
  internal challenges can be addressed systematically over time.
</p>
<p>
  Challenges to society arise from our external environment in addition to our internal structure. To prevent external threats from 
  blindsiding us, we must remain ever watchful of changes in our surroundings. One way to institutionalize this observation and to 
  incorporate it into policy is by giving communities of experts earned influence in the legislative process. Typically, this is 
  unnecessary because leaders see the obvious external threats without expert influence. For example, if scientists informed the 
  government about an imminent asteroid impact, policy makers would move to fund programs to address the danger. However, as discussed 
  earlier, there are times when biases and misaligned incentives cause individuals or even groups of leaders to turn a blind I to such 
  threats. In this case, we need to change the system so that expert consensus is capable of counteracting lobbying biases.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, we must make an inherent commitment to overcome a social bias. While perhaps less of a threat, a bias to exclude those 
  different from us hurts our strength as an inclusive nation. It prohibits us from reaching bipartisan consensus and from effectively 
  discussing controversial topics. Therefore, we must recommit to our founding principle that all people are created equal. We all have a 
  vote. We all have a voice. And we all have a need to be heard by the systems that organize us. And beyond that, we all have human needs 
  that an effective government empowers us to address - basic needs, but also the need to create, and the need to love, and the need be 
  accepted and be loved. Only with a commitment to inclusion can we truly use the rest of the tools to solve the difficult problems of a 
  global society.
</p>
<p>
  These tools to converge on a healthy balance of truth and positivity are all things we can do today. The sooner we enact changes to 
  discover and address threats unseen by our leaders today, the safer we will be in the future. Together, let us build a better future.

  <em>2016-10-19</em>
</h3>
<p>
  Masturbation is a normal and healthy behavior for both sexes, and in fact several, studies identify improved health in subjects who 
  masturbate more frequently, as compared to those who masturbate less frequently. Though as with many scientific investigations in which 
  the subject biological, there are studies which draw both beneficial and detrimental conclusions. But enough with the physicalism, 
  masturbation feels fucking great! Sadly, the nature of masturbation habits remains a largely personal and privately maintained aspect of 
  one's self identity. Let's examine masturbation, common practices, how it fits into society, and the consequences of various actions 
  surrounding masturbation in order to explore how we feel about when it's right and when it's wrong.
</p>
<p>
  About the author: Given that I personally hold the right to privacy in very low regard with respect to many other freedoms, discussing 
  anything about myself is relatively fun and easy. Even publicly. Even with strangers. On the topic of masturbation, blurring into 
  sexuality and other preferences at times, I tend toward fantasizing primarily about female human forms enjoying sexual pleasure, 
  especially orgasm. When I'm not masturbating, my thoughts about sex in general, as with my thoughts about generally everything, stray in 
  all directions. For example, I may consider the nature of a society in which bestiality is normal, or under what circumstances you might 
  sleep with a blood relative and have it be considered by most people as reasonable and moral acceptable (eg. accidentally, under extreme 
  duress, etc.). I have thought about what it would be like to be raped and how to (attempt to) enjoy being raped even if the circumstance 
  is highly undesirable, such as anal, then oral penetration by an ugly, dirty stranger with a very large penis.

<p>
  <em>
    Well over two hundred years ago now, Thomas Jefferson famously wrote, “All men are created equal.” Today, we still struggle with the 
    essence of that historic truth.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  What does it really mean that all men are created equal? We could go back many centuries to look at the nature of land ownership and how 
  it’s dispersal has moved gradually from those who came up with the idea to the general populous. We could reflect on the ever expanding 
  nature of civil rights protections, the extension of basic civil liberties to people of every race, creed, sex, gender, etc. We could 
  note how we often think of meritocracy and diversity as ideals yet to be realized. But, if we conceive of societal equality as newborns 
  entering into the world with an equal shot at success, rebellion ensues.
</p>
<p>
  No parent would think it equitable to restrict the ability to pass on wealth or privilege to its offspring. In this manner, as a 
  society, we clearly practice social Darwinism; the success and influence of each generation is transferred to the next through wealth, 
  fame and even power. At the same time, we have long established institutions (e.g. estate taxes) to reduce our natural tendency toward 
  social Darwinism. Ultimately, there is a balance between equality and pure social Darwinism that represents our current definition of 
  equality. However, the current state of affairs differs significantly from our intuition of true equality, which would provide basic 
  rights and healthy living conditions for all people. How is this possible?
</p>
<p>
  First, social Darwinism is a self-reinforcing tendency that promotes social stratification. Money makes more money, and people in 
  positions of power or fame tend to cling to their circumstances by whatever means necessary. On the other end of the spectrum, the most 
  neglected people will exist in whatever state society has deemed acceptable. As long as we feel like situational homelessness is okay, 
  people who want shelter will sleep on the street. As long as we feel like it’s fine for people to suffer in pain because they can’t 
  afford medical treatment, people will suffer. Certainly there are limits to what can be sustained as acceptable, and we will always be 
  forced to recon with the balance between that sustainability and what we deem to be minimally acceptable circumstances. Even so, is the 
  status quo what we want that balance to be? Intuitively, we know we can do better.
</p>
<p>
  Second, humans have yet to create a policy framework that successfully counter-balances our tendency toward social Darwinism. And for 
  good reason: it’s very difficult to accomplish. Perhaps even historically impossible. It’s been said that power corrupts and absolute 
  power corrupts absolutely. And because the equal distribution of power in society is and has always been inhibited by a need for 
  efficient decision making processes, we consolidate power. Maybe that’s why some people say that democracy is the worst form of 
  government people have ever tried, except for all the other forms of government.
</p>
<p>
  Because social Darwinism is such a powerful force in modern society, and because it’s a prevailing force throughout recorded history, we 
  need to try new things if it is a force with which we truly want to reckon. We need to experiment with stronger policies that ensure we 
  are living our self evident truth: “All men are created equal.” Currently, we allow social Darwinism to the extent that some people have 
  nothing, others too much. Regarding both the destitution and the extravagance we allow today, “That shit cray!”

    As our most fortunate members improve even beyond our natural human limits while some still starve in the streets, we can reflect on

    decide how we want to carry the present panorama of our shared experience into the future.

  When I brought up the topic of self-guided human evolution as a soon-to-be relevant topic concern, especially for well-off individuals, 
  a friend of mine paused. In a brief silence, his demeanor shifted slowly from dismissive to disgusted. He went on to explain how the 
  related topic of technology as a barrier had recently confronted him at the Allied Media Conference in Detroit. As a child of Chinese 
  immigrants, he grew up hearing the praises of technology as a great equalizer. Now, as a 38-year-old technology professional, he was 
  taken slightly aback by the realization that no longer could the basic tools for breaking ground in tech be acquired through the local 
  thrift store or the public library.
</p>
<p>
  Times have changed. And while realistically there always have been — and likely will be for a long time to come — unequal barriers to 
  success, right now, these barriers — supported by the practices of modern American and global society — continue to grow. Unfettered, 
  some groups will start pulling away from the pack, not just financially, but experientially as well. We live in an age where artificial 
  bionic devices are starting to outcompete our natural abilities. Replacement lenses allow you to see up to three times farther, and 
  artificial limbs outperform traditional ones. To prevent known genetic diseases and anomalies, you can screen for your offspring before 
  they are even conceived. And, biology isn’t the only frontier where technology is dramatically pushing the basic human experience to 
  previously unreachable heights.
</p>
<p>
  From Elon Musk’s mission to colonize Mars by 2030 to Google’s self-driving cars hitting the road and displacing millions of workers, the 
  future is coming — in all of its glory and in all of its horror. At the same time, the past has not left. Less than half the world has 
  access to the internet, over 1 million Americans lack indoor plumbing, and people still pass away daily from preventable disease, 
  dehydration and malnutrition. Stratification is commonplace and ever more extreme each day. In San Francisco, it’s possible to see boys 
  on shiny, minimalist, motorized transportation devices pass by dirty, old men sleeping in the street with less than 5 dollars to their 
  name.
</p>
<h4>Where are we going?</h4>
<p>
  To be cliche, the future holds endless possibilities. As a species, we will chose a path to venture down. Pre-emptive though this may 
  be, we ought to start strongly considering which paths we most prefer. With the privatization of space travel and the further 
  stratification of wealth, dystopian scenarios from science fiction become ever more tangible. At one extreme of unlikeliness is that 
  humans establish a sustainable Martian colony while the overpopulation and environmental degradation on Earth creates widespread famine 
  and decay. Alternatively yet also extremely, we may see humankind come together globally and put our world-wide issues in front of any 
  issues of national or personal pride. Will we work toward defining a box — a boundary, within which, human experience must be able to 
  fall, and simultaneously, be prevented from spilling out its top?
</p>
<p>
  The core philosophical issue is perhaps no more complicated than, “How should we treat our fellow human beings, our brothers and 
  sisters?” And yet, when asked on a universal level for all mankind, the question becomes mired in policy and politics, culture and 
  creed. Personally, I have little preference as to exactly where we go. Simply, I want to go together, with as many people as possible. 
  To grow up as a family.

    Specific Expectations: The Context of Wealthy Investors
  </a>

  <em>2015-05-27</em>
</h3>
<p>
  While <a href="http://govtechfund.com/">Govtech Fund</a> manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronbouganim">Ron Bouganim</a> was 
  speaking to a group of us at <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a> Headquarters today, I couldn’t help but 
  fixate on a specific statement. Only tangentially related to his main point, the statement was simple: “My investors are expecting a 4x 
  or 5x return on their investment.” Not, “hoping for,” or, “wanting,” but, “expecting.”
</p>
<p>
  He went on to clarify the period over which the return was expected and that it came out to a 25% per annum ROI. Given that investment 
  is basically a form of big picture gambling, I kept asking myself how intelligent, successful human beings could expect results that 
  differ so tremendously from the expected ROI in the market as a whole. For example, even over a relatively good period (since January of 
  2009), the S&P 500 only produced a 15% per annum ROI (as calculated <a href="http://dqydj.net/sp-500-return-calculator/">here</a>). 
  <a href="http://fortune.com/2011/01/27/investing-in-the-100-best-beats-the-market-hands-down/">A more solid investment strategy</a> will 
  likely yield such high returns only in the best years.
</p>
<p>
  The best explanation I can come up with is that very successful individuals (Govtech Fund has some high-powered investors — e.g. 
  <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/jeff-bezos/">Jeff Bezos</a>) have access to specific investment contexts that the rest of us 
  don’t. When you can afford to invest millions of dollars in a single place, the current economic climate lets you 
  ‘<a href="http://indianaangelnetwork.com/expected-return-on-investment.aspx">expect</a>’ to make money at a much higher rate of return 
  than the average investor.
</p>
<p>
  While I think this is pretty common knowledge — that super wealthy investors are privileged to a specific context with specific 
  expectations, expectations well above what I would consider ‘normal’ — it consistently makes me wonder, “Do I really want to live in a 
  world where power, influence and the course of human evolution are decided by such a small portion of the species?” And, does my answer 
  change if that world just happens to be more or less awesome?

  Evolution for all animal species occurs at the biological level. When gametes undergo meiosis, chromosomal crossover that occurred in the 
  parents' gonads ensures that offspring are significantly varied while retaining the basic traits of their progenitors. Some species are 
  social, and they may well undergo nuanced cultural evolution which makes things like the dolphin version of rape more or less acceptable 
  among larger groups of dolphins. I am not sure if this actually occurs, but one can certainly imagine that it might occur.

    Thought Experiment: How Would Standardized Income Distribution Have Impacted That?
  </a>

  <em>2015-04-21</em>
</h3>
<p>
  As I was reading about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/19/us/university-given-order-on-research.html">Research Priorities 
  Lawsuit</a> in loose connection with my current work at Code for America, I got sidetracked thinking about how a guaranteed minimum 
  income would perhaps offload a substantial portion of the burdens - strictly the financial portion, and more so, all areas that financial 
  burdens pour over into (relationships, healthcare, education, etc.) - surrounding behavioral and occupational changes, even in the face 
  of nostalgia toward upholding historical values and pastimes. In the face of mounting efficiencies accruing elsewhere throughout the 
  larger national or international systems that comprise humanity (pesticides use in agriculture in this case), the larger population is 
  often clearly and implicitly in favor of such transitions, and yet the dialogue surrounding the process of actually transitioning all too 
  frequently focuses on the large, non-monetary costs associated with the change (historical value preservation, culture change, 
  reeducation, etc.), while ignoring the financial costs, which may be greater still! Assuming that this discourse is largely an 
  unconscious societal byproduct of our emotional nature, how would guaranteed minimum income affect the situation? What important changes 
  would come to the occupational transition process? Would monetary aspects enter into the conversation to a greater or lesser degree than 
  they do currently? How would the conversation be changed in general?
</p>
<p>
  In this case, I was thinking specifically about a minimum income aspect of any hypothetical standardized income distribution scheme, and 
  I was thinking about the context of the history of CAFF and the Research Priorities Lawsuit specifically. In a larger thought experiment, 
  I might try applying the theme of "How would standardized income distribution have impacted that?" to other historical contexts.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe some other time I'll write my own answers to the questions I posed above; however, given the historical precedent of my 
  de-prioritization of blog-posting (most/all posts are either unpublished, incomplete or nonsensical - intrapersonal), that seems unlikely

  <em>2015-03-17</em>
</h3>
<p>
  While attending the <a href="http://hpmor.com/">HPMOR</a> Wrap party outside the Valley Life Sciences Building this past weekend, 
  <a href="http://rationality.org/">CFAR</a> Executive Director and Cofounder Anna Salamon, encouraged a group of UC-Berkeley students and 
  others (myself included) to write more under the premise that anything you convert into a physical artifact provides a natural extension 
  of your memory and is therefore beneficial. So, despite the tradeoffs inherent in recording my thoughts and experiences - particularly 
  for all to see, an aspect which Anna wasn't necessarily considering in her comments - here I am.
</p>
<p>
  Rather than discuss the fun and revelry of the HPMOR gathering though, I'm here to inscribe some thoughts I've had regarding human 
  population management policies dating back originally to sometime in college, between 2006 and 2010, though I think mostly originating in 
  early 2007. The original idea, as I recall, comes from ideating remedies to human overpopulation of Earth while also reading about cap 
  and trade regimes as an effort to regulate carbon emissions. The natural juxtaposition of these concepts led to a policy conception of a 
  cap and trade system on human life, which remains to this day my favorite systemic mechanism for directly addressing the root cause of 
  overpopulation. Please keep in mind, there are many other policies for which I would advocate first or under the most dire circumstances, 
  in addition to human population caps, which would attempt to manage population growth.
</p>
<p>
  For now, I'm going to ignore the various benefits and downsides of having an active human population management policy and simply focus 
  on my preferred the designed proposal for human population management, its benefits and its drawbacks. Perhaps in a later post I'll 
  return to comment on other policies and on why a human population management policy is or is not beneficial to have in the first place. 
  Let's begin with a brief description of why I'm choosing to discuss population management in the first place: because as humans have come 
  to control the evolution of their own species from sociological, technological and, likely soon to be, biological standpoints, population 
  size with respect to our environment and with respect to our goals for own evolution are impacted in a large way by the size of our 
  population. This one aspect of humanity is perhaps the simplest and most direct way to control our own evolution as a species.
</p>
<p>
  As such, the root of any human population management strategy should be to facilitate the desired evolution of humanity while maintaining 
  and advancing the quality of life for the species as a whole and for the individuals thereof. Rather than propose goals for humanity or 
  its evolution, I will focus on the impacts of population on quality of life while trying to avoid assumptions about which futures of our 
  species are most or least desirable. The discussion can be broken up along several spectra, of which we will examine effects on 
  individuals and effects on the whole population and on severity of the effects.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Work in progress (which is also true of the above, just a bit less so)...
</p>
<p>
  First, let's look at the effects of population size on the quality of life provided to an individual. If you have too few people, you 
  likely end up with a relatively less fulfilling life in the sense that one would expect a lower average quality of relationship 
  fulfillment. This is predominately due to the relative lack of other humans with whom to interact, which restricts your choices and 
  lowers the expected quality of interaction that results.
</p>
<p>
  Next, let's look at the effects of population size on the species as a whole. If you have too few people, you face in the extreme, the 
  existential risk of an extinction vortex, and in general, you face reduced robustness due to external pressures. If you have too many 
  people, you face in the extreme, risk of societal collapse due to resource mismanagement.
</p>
<p>
  Having a greater number of people with whom to interact will presumably increase one's quality of life to some point, and it will require 
  the resources of the system to be split among more individuals, requiring each individual to have a smaller allocation of resources 
  available to oneself. So presumably, there is some optimal number of people that should exist in any system with finite resources (e.g. 
  Earth). Since the optimal number is dependent on a myriad, perhaps infinite number of variables, I'll refrain from trying to come up with 
  a specific target or upper bound. As a lower bound, let's say that humans don't want humans to go extinct (I know that some individual 
  humans argue for human extinction, but this is not a commonly held belief) and therefore, we need enough genetic variation in our 
  population to prevent an extinction vortex.

<p>
  I just attempted to write a blog entry in third person, complaining about how feminist and gender queer blog entries sometimes become 
  very dark. Generalizing the bleak, derogatory abyss of <insert links to unnecessarily negative blogs here>, you find articles ranging 
  from mild, that cast blame for how people feel when they're exposed to adversity, to vile articles, that blame others for existing as 
  they are (Or, if we try to look at them more positively: as in their very existence makes me feel bad about myself by comparison, not 
  because they are bad to exist, but because the world is unfair). They range from mopey yet fairly compassionate to people of various 
  identities () to predominately hateful and loathing (). The latter make me feel, perhaps unsurprisingly, hate-filled and loathsome. Here 
  was the start to that blog entry, and I really wanted to keep going, but it was just so hard. It's much easier to rant than it is to 
  write a constructive commentary on the nature of a discussion:
</p>
<p>
  Reading a number of feminist and LGBT centric blog posts over the past several years, most of them have the right idea, focusing on 
  awareness and empowerment of groups that have traditionally been underserved and underrepresented. The spirt of the movement seems to be 
  about empowering individuals to live life as they feel compelled to live. Certainly, we all want the freedom to experience the world and 
  interact with others in constructive, mutually beneficial ways, and some groups have been historically, systematically excluded from 
  flowing through society in that way. Emphasizing that fact is important, and should definitely continue to take center stage until it 
  becomes a reality. And, that's where it could end.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes it does end there. Occasionally, though, it continues into shall we say, darker realms, where negativity creeps in and people 
  are encouraged to feel that, simply because they are lucky, they are somehow inherently wrong or bad or evil. Recognizably, usually, the 
  intent of these darker facets is to further the awareness of less well-know societal aspects by prompting the readers to self-examine and 
  analyze how they personally affect and are affected by groups with whom they may otherwise have considered only briefly. This is 
  reasonable, and it can be done in a more positive way. For example, it works to to tell stories where the reader identifies with the 
  primary actor and in which the primary actor goes through a transformative experience in relation to the subject matter. Alternatively, 
  direct questions and answers based on personal experience are a good way to provide perspective. Do you know anyone who is homosexual? 
  Have you ever thought about what it would be like to be physically intimate with someone in order to share a human experience, even if 
  that person is different from you in ways of which you have little understanding? Have you ever tried or even considered being someone 
  you just met and who compulsively repulses you because of who they are? Are you repulsed because that's who you are, or are you repulsed 
  because you have yet to fathom who they are?

  And still, we are so different that any union is sure to be rife with compromises. Big important compromises: children, career, 
  friendships, hobbies, etc. So why is it that one still wants something so fundamentally problematic. Is it timing, luck, fate or fortune? 
  Is it biology, physiology or psychology? Is it romance, magic or something else?
</p>
<p>
  I think for me it's balance. Being able to respect and identify with another competent, rational, intelligent human being and share our 
  observations, thoughts and interpretations having them be different, even mutually exclusive, and yet still valid to each individual 
  separately. Having the divergence be so close to the core, the most desirable, passionate relationships are inherently the most 
  problematic. Hopefully I'm just too young and have yet to discover true love, something similar yet simpler.

<p>
  I'm making this into a public diary. It is not a blog. It is for me. It's public, perhaps selfishly, for me as well. Because I want to 
  live without secrets, it is for me, my freedom.
</p>
<p>The below content was written a few months ago and is unrelated to the above decision.</p>
<p>
  I received my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering from UW Madison in 2010. Still trying to develop life goals, I worked at 
  Epic in the Technical Services role for 2.8 years where I gained a wonderful respect and appreciation for technology's ability to 
  transform entire sectors of the economy. In order to pursue a greater understanding of software and business, I left Epic and started 
  work at EatStreet.com, a Madison startup creating an internet ordering platform for independent local restaurants and small chains. 
  Currently, I do freelance work for another pre-market venture aimed at helping accounting practices go paper-free, while also continuing 
  to learn and work at EatStreet.
</p>
<p>
  Passion for understanding others' ideas, community, equality and global human development motivates me far more than money, influence, 
  power and at times even more than relationships. At TEDx Madison 2014, I want to learn about and to try to understand other people's 
  motivations, ideas and experiences and how they relate to my own passions and motivations. If requested, I would happily want to put 
  together a talk on observations regarding current trends in the development of global human culture and society (diplomacy/international 
  law, economic and financial trends, language/housing/clothing/food, technology, health, education, etc.; basically an overview of - as a 
  species - where we've come from, where we are, and perhaps touching briefly on some places we might yet go); I would want to present it 
  if I thought it was good enough and if others validated that opinion.

  Basically two things can happen when one of the leading super powers finally goes so far as to simply not pay back our debts in an 
  agreeable manner. War and forgiveness. For the sake of understanding how the citizens of the lender nations feel in this circumstance, 
  let's pretend that the US is actually a lender nation, and that the EU is actually a debtor nation that owes the US trillions of dollars 
  and is about to default on it's debt and working on renegotiating that debt with the US. The president is working with Congress to decide

  If all of mankind were represented by a single individual, how well are that person's needs being met? And, what could that person change 
  to more adequately meet it's own needs? I'm American, specifically united statesian, so I'm going to go ahead and assume this person has 
  needs based off an average American lifestyle, but if you're reading this from another country, go ahead and extract and augment facets 
  of individual need as you see fit. Yes, I'm applying global statistics to an American mindset of needs (just to be clear).

  Choosing your relationships is largely considered a fundamental right in our society. True, this is not necessarily the case in other 
  cultures, but in the United States, you can marry, divorce, disown, disinherit, inherit, etc. pretty much at will. There are a few 
  notable exceptions: 1) you cannot choose to add to your family outside of the one living spouse per person rule (and in some states that 
  person still has to be of the opposite gender) and 2) acknowledgement of children is forcible under certain circumstances. These 
  circumstances disproportionately affect men, as physically, pregnancy disproportionately affects women.

</h3>
<p>
  Sex should never, ever be tied directly with offspring unless it's someone's, and preferably multiple people's choice. Abortion should be 
  legal because a person's right to the pursuit of happiness through sexual pleasure should trump the state's right to protect the 
  potentiality of human life (context matters, so certainly there are other epochs when this is not true). Abortion should be legal right 
  now. But it's not.
</p>
<p>
  Somehow, the state still maintains that it has a vested interest in protecting the well being of a fetus, and that it's interest in doing 
  so increases as the fetus matures. This is probably wrong, but most people cannot yet see it that way; they don't want to see it. Why 
  does the state have a vested interest in protecting an unborn human? Presumably, we assume from a legal standpoint, reflecting societies 
  values, that human life is inherently valuable to the society, and therefore this makes sense. The value of the human life comes in many 
  forms - it's joyous and harmonious relationships to others, the contributions is makes to maintaining our species and our societal 
  structure, etc. I think we can all agree that human life is generally valuable in both quality and quantity. But, like anything, too much 
  is not good. If the planet were filled entirely with humans we couldn't move, we couldn't leave, and we would all pretty much get bored 
  and want to die. Economically, we probably want a population size that optimizes for both quantity and quality of life. At some point, we 
  don't want more people. What would be some good indicators that we have enough people? And at that point, does the government still have 
  a vested interest in protecting an unborn human? The answer is that we have a vested interest in agreeing to policy structures locally, 
  nationally, globally that help regulate the population in such a way that we generally all agree is mutually beneficial. This is 
  incredibly difficult. Ideally, we would not regulate, people would just have a small number of children, and thankfully, this happens 
  naturally to some extent.
</p>
<p>
  People are unjustifiably hubris when it comes to defending the nature of our species. We have failed before, and we will fail again. What 
  we can hope to achieve is to learn from our failures and lessen the magnitude of each one consecutively. In a way, that will happen when 
  we ruin our planet and or have a lasting catastrophic global depression sometime over the course of the next several decades. Let's 
  compare our global civilization to that of the Easter Islanders. We likely won't fail in the sense that we will all have to leave the 
  planet, because 1) we can't leave and because 2) extinction would require an incredibly extreme change of global climate, potentially 
  beyond the likes of climate change and/or nuclear war (though I would be interested in a well though-out counter claim). We will fail in 
  the sense that we're effectively lowering the carrying capacity of our planet in the long run and at a minimum we will undergo massive 
  penalties to the quality of life experienced by human beings across the globe, and potentially a sizable loss in the quantity of that 
  life as well.
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately, my point isn't that abortion should be legal - it should, but that's not my point really. My point is that it should be legal 
  so that we correctly balance our desire for quantity of life against our desire for quality of life. We want abortion to be legal, all 
  abortion. And, we want everyone to feel safe and secure about meeting their sexual needs. Let's legalize all abortion where it's someones 
  choice. Forward!

  Today sucked. I wasn't able to focus at work, partially because I was attempting to do things that are fairly boring like write and 
  validate unit tests for a bunch of old xml endpoints, and partially because I was distracted by my incessant desire to feel in control. 
  Grams asked me recently if I felt in control of my life and I just sort of laughed. I think that I would have said yes until about six or 
  nine months ago. It's still quite a strange question, what is control. Our understanding of the universe seems to be that things are 
  largely determined by the nature of random details, and that control is largely an abstract illusion. Even when I know what I want, why I 
  want it, and approximately how to get it, I can fail to actually act toward what I want, or I can be distracted or realize that maybe I 
  don't want it after all. Worst of all, you can end up getting either something you didn't plan for that is perceived as negative (this 
  made me cry today - http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-hardest-thing-you-have-ever-done) or you can get something that you explicitly

  From an Email to a Lawyer - 
  <em>2013-05-06</em>
</h3>
<p>
  I'd like to introduce myself and explain the impossible moral predicament , okay, perhaps that's overly dramatic, but no one would deny 
  that it's a tough situation, in which I find myself. My name is Grant Robert Smith, and I currently don't know what to do. I have never 
  wanted to be a parent, and I currently still do not want to be a parent. I have been forced by the universe to strongly reconsider 
  whether being a parent is the right thing to do, and despite the nature of my current situation, my moral conviction currently leads me 
  to believe that it's still not the right thing for me to do to be a parent. My problem is that the nature of the laws in this country at 
  this time (USA, Earth - 2013 AD) do not permit me to ask, in good conscious, that the court determine that I am not a parent - despite my 
  fundamental moral resolve to such an end. To do so would, perhaps, undermine the nature of society by forcing upon it a change so vast 
  and so fundamental that the law itself, at least in certain regards, might not sustain us. This is my story:
</p>
<p>
  …
</p>
<p>
  After graduating college nearly three years ago, I started working at <<company>> where I met R. We shared the same group of friends and 
  hung out together regularly for about a year before becoming roommates with two of the other people from that friend group, <<name>> and 
  <<name>> on August 16, 2011. During that time R became interested in me, but being a fairly self-absorbed and high-minded individual, I 
  never noticed; this is likely because understanding other people's interests and world views is not a natural strength of mine - though I 
  work hard at it. At one point, she asked me directly, "Do you have any interest in me?" To which, as a blunt and honest person, I 
  replied, "No." Subsequently, I forgot about this instance completely and have it in my mind now only as a story retold to me by R, but I 
  don't doubt the nature of the story.
</p>
<p>
  …
</p>
<p>
  First, I should explain this: who is R, to me? R is a wonderful person, capable of much compassion, joy, hard work and love. She has 
  added a lot to my life. I have learned about how to phrase my thoughts in a more empathetic manner and what it means to be romantic from 
  her (though I’ll admit I have a lot of room for improvement yet in both areas). I have also learned how to better empathize with people, 
  especially those who want to be parents, a concept which is quite foreign to me. I'm very grateful for that. I'm quite certain, that like 
  most parents, she loves her daughter E more than life itself. To the best of my knowledge she loves and respects me, but her world view 
  is so disparate from mind that I'm failing to help her understand who I am or why my situation is impossible, despite my continuous and 
  consistent efforts. Recently, she stopped talking to me all of the sudden, and I don't fully understand why, and it saddens me. But, I'll 
  get back to this part.
</p>
<p>
  …
</p>
<p>
  For the weekend of New Years 2012, I planned a trip to visit friends and family in Mequon and Chicago, and rather spontaneously. I asked 
  R if she'd like to "drive me" (those were my exact words, haha) to Chicago because she didn't have any plans and our roommates were also 
  going to Chicago to see friends. Rather to my surprise, she said yes; she packed a bag and we drove to Chicago shortly thereafter.
</p>
<p>
  In Chicago, we stayed at my friend Jorge's house. Jorge's a relatively unique individual in my mind because he has an incredible 
  commitment to the truth, much like myself. Additionally, he enjoys helping people and understanding who they are and how they think. The 
  nature of the company with whom we spent New Years Eve and the atmosphere of the conversations had were incredibly open. It was then that 
  I learned about how R had been molested by her grandfather as a child, and that she had a history of depression and difficulty trusting 
  others. It was also that night when I realized that she had a romantic interest in me (apparently the direct question about whether I had 
  an interest in her didn't tip me off - yes, I can be that dense). I shared that I did have some interest in having a more intimate 
  relationship with R, but that I was opposed to the idea because I knew she wanted children, and I knew that I did not, and therefore I 
  knew that it could never work out as a long-term relationship.
</p>
<p>
  …
</p>
<p>
  I also said that I wasn't physically attracted to R, which was a poor way of saying that I find it difficult to respect people, 
  especially women, who don't respect their bodies; I don't know if this is important to the story, but it kind of feels like it, so I'm 
  including it anyway. For the record, I lose some respect for men who don't respect their bodies too, but my pursuits of physical intimacy 
  with men are generally more focused on their desire of me, so I prioritize their respect for their bodies somewhat lower...
</p>
<p>
  Generally, I'm pretty idealistic, and I've always been rather more interested in long-term relationships than short-term ones, but I was 
  23 and a half years old, had never been in a consistently emotionally and/or physically intimate relationship (I had never even kissed a 
  girl - reads: but I had made out with guys - except maybe once on a dare, but I don't remember if that was before or after this though), 
  and R was obviously interested in me. One of the things that Sarah, another friend visiting Jorge that night, said to me which has stuck 
  with me is that part of relationships is "the mess." You can sit back and analyze and contemplate and plan and ponder, but eventually, 
  the only way to learn is to jump into the mess for yourself and see what happens. It probably sticks with me because of the irony: 'cause 
  I sure am messy now.
</p>
<p>
  …
</p>
<p>
  We wrapped up the weekend by meeting up with Matt and Michelle and then driving home to Madison. In the car, I continued with the 
  openness of the previous evening and shared with R the things that came to my mind that I felt were most important or troubling to me at 
  the time. I remember a few of them: I have trouble initiating physical intimacy because I don't want to make other people feel 
  uncomfortable. This causes me extreme sexual frustration at times because I don't know what the right thing to do is in many situations, 
  and because societally, women aren't attracted to sexually non-aggressive men, even if they are incredibly self-assured in almost every 
  other aspect of life. After I get back to a point where I'm able to form intimate relationships without unduly interjecting my emotional 
  burden on potential partners, maybe I’ll get a chance to work on that :)
</p>
<p>
  …
</p>
<p>
  (To Do: Finish the story.)
</p>
<p>
  [The short version: we start having sex. She agrees that she will abort any life inadvertently created as an unwanted byproduct of our 
  physical intimacy. She starts talking about her plans to have a child in 2 years (at age 28/29), this includes talk of the cost of 
  artificial insemination and of the cost and adoption as well as mentions of the difficulties in attempting to adopt as a single mother. 
  She gets pregnant (by accident - her claim is that she was on birth control of a low dose and occasionally would take it at different 
  times of the day, which her doctor says would reduce the efficacy of it to 94%. We used condoms also, though not consistently). She tells 
  me that she has changed her mind and decides not to get an abortion; I am outraged. I become as angry as I have ever been; I say very 
  mean things and feel very badly for saying them. I cannot remember specifics of those conversations because I mostly blocked them out of 
  my memory. Eventually, I rectify the scenario in my mind by considering myself the sperm donor and stating as such to her. I call a 
  lawyer and ask if the state will recognize a written contract stating our intention for me to be considered the sperm donor in the eyes 
  of the state. He tells me that he’s never heard of such a thing, but that it would be a waste of my time because the state would almost 
  certainly find the contract to be invalid given the nature of parenthood. In retrospect, I think that he’s probably right, and at the 
  time I trust his judgement and do not pursue the contract further. I state that I am not nor will I ever be the parent of her child; this 
  makes her sad, but I continue to say it anyway over the entire course of the pregnancy and even to this day, for it is the only way I 
  have ever felt or thought. We continue sleeping together because I love R as a person and because the relationship fulfills a lot of my 
  needs: I have a companion who appreciates and desires my company, emotionally and physically. She is capable of entertaining herself, and 
  I trust her to support herself as a human being on her own, even when she is very depressed. I am intellectually engaged by the nature of 
  her mental state, which seems to be internally inconsistent, and is therefore difficult for me to understand. I now realize that most 
  people, even those who are stubborn have the ability to change their mind in certain circumstances, even on very important moral issues. 
  Many people also have the ability to misinterpret their own intentions and change their moral frameworks because their frameworks are not 
  solidly founded on guiding principles like mine (The one absolute truth is that there is no absolute truth; everything depends on 
  context. After that I have a firm and steadfast commitment to doing what’s right. I attempt to determine this by considering the context 
  of my situation in combination with my guiding principles of truth, balance, and positivity.) ]
</p>
<p>
  …
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I'd like to answer one more question for you: Who am I? Who is Grant Robert Smith? I've spent a considerable amount of time 
  answering this question, so please do not take my answer lightly:
</p>
<p>
  I live my life trying to align what I want, with what is right: I want to do what is right, and I try to make that which is right the 
  thing that I do. I do my best to define what is right be looking at the context in which I find myself...
</p>
<p>
  Example: What is the right thing to do with my life? I think that the right thing to do with my life is to devote myself to the 
  development of software tools to aid in the transparency, accessibility, and openness of government. I think this because when I look at 
  humanity in the context of the era and in the context of the world in which we live, I see many large problems without obvious solutions. 
  I see the nature of software solutions changing the world around us more quickly than the changes of any other field. No matter what my 
  contribution, it will therefore likely be greatest and most efficacious if focused at least in part on a software based solution. The 
  internet and the ever expanding nature of global trade are transforming the world into a single cultural unit, slowly but surely. 
  Humanity as a whole requires certain basic elements in order to meet its needs, and they are obvious and well-established, yet they are 
  seldom made explicit and prioritized; therefore, I see room for relatively simple improvement in that area.
</p>
<p>
  (To Do: Add more content on how I think and why I think that way...)
</p>
<p>
  …
</p>
<p>
  My fate is now largely in the hands of complete strangers, and I don't even know if I have a valid moral grounds on which to defend 
  myself, my dignity, the very essence of who I am and what I do as a human being with the life that I have been granted. What do you 
  think I should do? How do I balance my moral obligations to myself, to humanity, and to all of the individuals whom I love and interact 
  with on a regular basis? Should I go to court? Should I defend myself? How? To what extent? Should I forgive R? (Yes.) To what extent? (I 
  have no idea. Ideally, fully - done; but how should I act?) Should I ever talk to her again? (Probably, because the only way to prevent 
  someone from knowing you is to intentionally deny them all interaction. Does that make me weak? I know many people who would say yes. I 
  think that the answer is yes and no at the same time; it depends on how you look at it. What is weakness after all?) Should I forgive my 
  country? (Ideally, yes - done.) Should I leave a country that has defiled my humanity? (Probably not, it’s largely the nature of things; 
  the law denies itself the ability to chose in this case. The law has a more obligation to uphold itself and the judges and jury as agents 
  of the law and I myself as a citizen of this nation of a moral obligation to uphold the law. I also have a moral obligation to point out 
  where it’s wrong and how.) Should I go on a hunger strike? (Probably not.) Have I dishonored myself? Have I done anything wrong? What 
  does it mean to be a parent? Are there moral obligations implicit in the act of having consensual sex? Do the moral obligations extend 
  unambiguously and universally to all situations? (No: that would defy logic since the one absolute truth is that there are no absolute 
  truths. Similarly (from a legal lexicon), the one fundamental right is that fundamental rights are subject to the context of the universe 
  and therefore cannot be universally applicable to all situations. There are always exceptions.)
</p>
<p>
  (Just had this thought... Isn’t it ironic that if I were a bad person, I would be forcibly denied paternity by the state, even if I 
  desired with all of my being to be a parent, but that because I’m a good person, I’m forced to bear an obligatory moral burden with 
  considerable liberty considerations, even though I deny that moral framework with all of my being as inconsistent and wrong.) These 
  questions plague my mind; I’m having trouble sleeping at night. I’m obsessing about Constitutional law, the origins of parenthood, the 
  modern definition of parenthood, what it means to be a sperm  donor, the moral ambiguity and inconsistencies of the law. These topics, 
  those questions, they distract me from the work that I want to be doing for my new company at my new job. I have a moral obligation to do 
  a good job at work and this burden of doing the right thing in a most difficult situation overcomes me. I am nearly lost. The nature of 
  the situation gives everyone a public forum on which to discuss the nature of my morality and who I am as a human being. What effect does 
  this have on my ability to form relationships in the future? How can I trust people? There is so much uncertainty, and it all feels so 
  meaningful and overwhelming. Thankfully, there is one thing I know for certain, it will all be over in 19 years. :)
