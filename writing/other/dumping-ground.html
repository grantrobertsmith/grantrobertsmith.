    Implementing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights

</h3>
<p>
  While there is at least one fundamental inconsistency within the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDoHR) as it’s written, it pretty 
  well covers what we hope a mature human civilization would provide to every member therein, should they choose to take it (a caveat I’ll 
  return to later). At the same time, everything in the declaration is basically a service in one form or another and all services require 
  money to provide. Therefore in practice, various nations are able to implement the UDoHR to different degrees and with different 
  strategies and challenges to their implementations.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe take a more in depth look at some example countries, so on and so forth (not just the ones that are close to UDoHR from a Western 
  sense, but also maybe Saudi Arabia, Italy, China, Singapore and Somalia).
</p>
<p>
  Stepping out of the box, let’s look at how the Universe restricts its shape and one way we might go about trying to implement as many of 
  the UDoHR tenants as possible on Earth today.

  <a href="https://grantsmithblog.blogspot.com/2016/10/balancing-truth-and-positivity.html">Balancing Truth and Positivity</a> - 
  <em>2016-10-19</em>
</h3>
<p>
  Balancing truth and positivity is a fundamental aspect of my personal philosophy. It underpins many of my morals, goals, feelings, 
  thoughts and actions. And while it's certainly not a religion, it is my religion or at least an important component thereof. To the 
  extent that every person, organization or group, be it formal or informal, has religion, as in a unique set of guiding principles, from 
  my vantage point, it appears far more common to greater emphasize positivity than to emphasize truth. An inconvenient truth is aptly 
  named for this reason, but global climate change is not the only topic appropriate for that title. Maybe I'd go on to talk about the 
  *socioeconomic struggle* of middle class Europeans, Japanese and Americans in the face of globalization, or overpopulation, or peak oil, 
  or the *potential obsolescence of human labor* and the plethora of *out of work* or unemployed individuals. But what we really need to 
  talk about is how we got to this place of inconvenient truths and how we might yet walk away with scars that fade instead of amputated 
  limbs and *traumatic memory loss* or PTSD (motivated forgetting on Wikipedia).
</p>
<p>
  Our positivity today exists in the context of our past and our conception thereof. Modern cultural understanding comes from a long 
  history of American success over the past 100 years. Perception of human history, dating back centuries and millennia, further reinforces 
  modern attitudes. Schooling, entertainment and almost every other exposure to history focuses on the impressive, the eventful, the 
  progressive and the majestic. Since these times are long gone, we package most historical events together in our minds. We lose 
  perspective on the immense amount of time it took to arrive at our present condition. In reality, civilizations rose and fell across the 
  planet over the course of several thousand years. There were periods of progress and periods of stagnation and periods of regression. 
  Societal and economic growth only happen sometimes. We seem to have forgotten this recently.
</p>
<p>
  Or, rather than, forget the normalcy of economic stagnation and stability, perhaps we lack the education. Living in times of growth and 
  prosperity for generations, we learned to expect it. America has been a global superpower for about 150 years now. The industrial 
  revolution ratcheted a territorial expansion (robbery of natives’ land) and population growth into previously unfathomable demographic 
  transformation. Cities became the size of empires and with more people and more technological experimentation, the acceleration of 
  breakthrough after breakthrough begun over a century ago continues today. Again we lose context; we focus on globalization’s novelty, 
  rather than the typicality of temporary expansion followed by long, steady lulls.
</p>
<p>
  Globalization has brought amazing magnitude and interconnectedness to our growth. At the same time, we’ve moved at different rates, 
  leaving many groups stratified and siloed. Importantly, the groups with greatest influence and power have retained their positivity with 
  their fame, money and success. As an investment banker, programmer, doctor, CEO or any one of so many profitable roles in society, the 
  positivity comes as expected, token, unsurprising. We in the United States miss the mobility required to balance the past’s optimism with 
  the troubling realities of the present. The diversity of opinion reflective of the true state of affairs percolates slowly into the minds 
  of society’s rich leaders and isolated academics.
</p>
<p>
  These societal organization issues thrive also because of our individual biases. In its difficulty, fighting the innate drive of our 
  nature parallels knowing what we have yet to learn. Even after the truth presents itself to our face, *we want to reject it*. Sometimes, 
  personal motives make the desire to deny the truth even worse. As a widely accepted example, take the tobacco industry’s denial of 
  cigarette’s link to cancer. At first, I’m sure the business leaders simply wanted to refuse the results because human nature drove them 
  to favor hope over truth. After tests confirmed the results, however, the fault shifts to their conscious decision making process. What 
  started in their biology was reinforced by their desire to make money, and rejection of fact cemented in their brains. In the worst case, 
  the untruth is a neurological parasite that spreads to infect other hosts. If they too are predisposed to lie because of their 
  incentives, similar complications continue to cause verbal vomit and allow the parasite to continue its lifecycle. Even when the issue 
  is less contagious, hidden only by human nature, it threatens to grow on it’s own. Unfortunately, we as a society make these dangerous 
  subjects commonplace by allowing positivity to outweigh truth.
</p>
<p>
  Any number of inconvenient subjects important to our future avoid meaningful discussion. The most challenging ones endanger our very 
  existence.
</p>
<p>
  Bringing balance back to our positivity is a challenge we can and must pass. Thankfully, we posses several tools suited to this undertaking. We can focus on evidence-based policy. We can run more frequent experiments to test policy initiatives. We can give experts more authority when our external environment challenges us. We can recommit to inclusive politics, where all voices are heard and valued. A combination of all these strategies will give the best chance of balancing truth and positivity in America and throughout the world.
</p>
<p>
  It’s true that humans have optimistic goals. We have policy for the sake of reaching these goals. For example, when we wanted to go to the moon, we created a space program. When we want to reduce homelessness, we alter zoning and economic policies to spur development and job growth. Yet, the goals rarely exist in the written policy itself. By pursuing goal oriented legislation, we hold ourselves more accountable to our history of goal achievement. Goal oriented legislation prevents us from hiding or forgetting failures to meet goals and deadlines. It creates a framework for evidence based policy and experimentation, and it makes the truth more plain.
</p>
<p>
  Experimenting with policy implementation and using the results as evidence for altering our policies and platforms will help us find the 
  downsides we miss in our organic social organization. While ideas for goals, metrics, prioritization and experiments should come from the 
  people, evidence and experimental results should inform the policies based on those ideas. While higher levels of government sometimes 
  use lower levels to experiment with various social policy implementations, cities could be leveraged far more as proving grounds. In this 
  way, even if the state or federal government is divided, experiments can be designed to test a proposed policy from either side. Suburban 
  or rural communities could similarly be used as test subjects for new policies. In this way, social ills and internal challenges can be 
  addressed systematically over time.
</p>
<p>
  Challenges to society arise from our external environment in addition to our internal structure. To prevent external threats from 
  blindsiding us, we must remain ever watchful of changes in our surroundings. One way to institutionalize this observation and to 
  incorporate it into policy is by giving communities of experts earned influence in the legislative process. Typically, this is 
  unnecessary because leaders see the obvious external threats without expert influence. For example, if scientists informed the government 
  about an imminent asteroid impact, policy makers would move to fund programs to address the danger. However, as discussed earlier, there 
  are times when biases and misaligned incentives cause individuals or even groups of leaders to turn a blind I to such threats. In this 
  case, we need to change the system so that expert consensus is capable of counteracting lobbying biases.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, we must make an inherent commitment to overcome a social bias. While perhaps less of a threat, a bias to exclude those different 
  from us hurts our strength as an inclusive nation. It prohibits us from reaching bipartisan consensus and from effectively discussing 
  controversial topics. Therefore, we must recommit to our founding principle that all people are created equal. We all have a vote. We 
  all have a voice. And we all have a need to be heard by the systems that organize us. And beyond that, we all have human needs that an 
  effective government empowers us to address - basic needs, but also the need to create, and the need to love, and the need be accepted 
  and be loved. Only with a commitment to inclusion can we truly use the rest of the tools to solve the difficult problems of a global 
  society.
</p>
<p>
  These tools to converge on a healthy balance of truth and positivity are all things we can do today. The sooner we enact changes to 
  discover and address threats unseen by our leaders today, the safer we will be in the future. Together, let us build a better future.

  <em>2016-10-19</em>
</h3>
<p>
  Masturbation is a normal and healthy behavior for both sexes, and in fact several, studies identify improved health in subjects who 
  masturbate more frequently, as compared to those who masturbate less frequently. Though as with many scientific investigations in which 
  the subject biological, there are studies which draw both beneficial and detrimental conclusions. But enough with the physicalism, 
  masturbation feels fucking great! Sadly, the nature of masturbation habits remains a largely personal and privately maintained aspect of 
  one's self identity. Let's examine masturbation, common practices, how it fits into society, and the consequences of various actions 
  surrounding masturbation in order to explore how we feel about when it's right and when it's wrong.
</p>
<p>
  About the author: Given that I personally hold the right to privacy in very low regard with respect to many other freedoms, discussing 
  anything about myself is relatively fun and easy. Even publicly. Even with strangers. On the topic of masturbation, blurring into 
  sexuality and other preferences at times, I tend toward fantasizing primarily about female human forms enjoying sexual pleasure, 
  especially orgasm. When I'm not masturbating, my thoughts about sex in general, as with my thoughts about generally everything, stray in 
  all directions. For example, I may consider the nature of a society in which bestiality is normal, or under what circumstances you might 
  sleep with a blood relative and have it be considered by most people as reasonable and moral acceptable (eg. accidentally, under extreme 
  duress, etc.). I have thought about what it would be like to be raped and how to (attempt to) enjoy being raped even if the circumstance 
  is highly undesirable, such as anal, then oral penetration by an ugly, dirty stranger with a very large penis.

  Evolution for all animal species occurs at the biological level. When gametes undergo meiosis, chromosomal crossover that occurred in the 
  parents' gonads ensures that offspring are significantly varied while retaining the basic traits of their progenitors. Some species are 
  social, and they may well undergo nuanced cultural evolution which makes things like the dolphin version of rape more or less acceptable 
  among larger groups of dolphins. I am not sure if this actually occurs, but one can certainly imagine that it might occur.

    Thought Experiment: How Would Standardized Income Distribution Have Impacted That?
  </a>
  -
  <em>2015-04-21</em>
</h3>
<p>
  As I was reading about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/19/us/university-given-order-on-research.html">Research Priorities 
  Lawsuit</a> in loose connection with my current work at Code for America, I got sidetracked thinking about how a guaranteed minimum 
  income would perhaps offload a substantial portion of the burdens - strictly the financial portion, and more so, all areas that financial 
  burdens pour over into (relationships, healthcare, education, etc.) - surrounding behavioral and occupational changes, even in the face 
  of nostalgia toward upholding historical values and pastimes. In the face of mounting efficiencies accruing elsewhere throughout the 
  larger national or international systems that comprise humanity (pesticides use in agriculture in this case), the larger population is 
  often clearly and implicitly in favor of such transitions, and yet the dialogue surrounding the process of actually transitioning all too 
  frequently focuses on the large, non-monetary costs associated with the change (historical value preservation, culture change, 
  reeducation, etc.), while ignoring the financial costs, which may be greater still! Assuming that this discourse is largely an 
  unconscious societal byproduct of our emotional nature, how would guaranteed minimum income affect the situation? What important changes 
  would come to the occupational transition process? Would monetary aspects enter into the conversation to a greater or lesser degree than 
  they do currently? How would the conversation be changed in general?
</p>
<p>
  In this case, I was thinking specifically about a minimum income aspect of any hypothetical standardized income distribution scheme, and 
  I was thinking about the context of the history of CAFF and the Research Priorities Lawsuit specifically. In a larger thought experiment, 
  I might try applying the theme of "How would standardized income distribution have impacted that?" to other historical contexts.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe some other time I'll write my own answers to the questions I posed above; however, given the historical precedent of my 
  de-prioritization of blog-posting (most/all posts are either unpublished, incomplete or nonsensical - intrapersonal), that seems unlikely

  <em>2015-03-17</em>
</h3>
<p>
  While attending the <a href="http://hpmor.com/">HPMOR</a> Wrap party outside the Valley Life Sciences Building this past weekend, 
  <a href="http://rationality.org/">CFAR</a> Executive Director and Cofounder Anna Salamon, encouraged a group of UC-Berkeley students and 
  others (myself included) to write more under the premise that anything you convert into a physical artifact provides a natural extension 
  of your memory and is therefore beneficial. So, despite the tradeoffs inherent in recording my thoughts and experiences - particularly 
  for all to see, an aspect which Anna wasn't necessarily considering in her comments - here I am.
</p>
<p>
  Rather than discuss the fun and revelry of the HPMOR gathering though, I'm here to inscribe some thoughts I've had regarding human 
  population management policies dating back originally to sometime in college, between 2006 and 2010, though I think mostly originating in 
  early 2007. The original idea, as I recall, comes from ideating remedies to human overpopulation of Earth while also reading about cap 
  and trade regimes as an effort to regulate carbon emissions. The natural juxtaposition of these concepts led to a policy conception of a 
  cap and trade system on human life, which remains to this day my favorite systemic mechanism for directly addressing the root cause of 
  overpopulation. Please keep in mind, there are many other policies for which I would advocate first or under the most dire circumstances, 
  in addition to human population caps, which would attempt to manage population growth.
</p>
<p>
  For now, I'm going to ignore the various benefits and downsides of having an active human population management policy and simply focus 
  on my preferred the designed proposal for human population management, its benefits and its drawbacks. Perhaps in a later post I'll 
  return to comment on other policies and on why a human population management policy is or is not beneficial to have in the first place. 
  Let's begin with a brief description of why I'm choosing to discuss population management in the first place: because as humans have come 
  to control the evolution of their own species from sociological, technological and, likely soon to be, biological standpoints, population 
  size with respect to our environment and with respect to our goals for own evolution are impacted in a large way by the size of our 
  population. This one aspect of humanity is perhaps the simplest and most direct way to control our own evolution as a species.
</p>
<p>
  As such, the root of any human population management strategy should be to facilitate the desired evolution of humanity while maintaining 
  and advancing the quality of life for the species as a whole and for the individuals thereof. Rather than propose goals for humanity or 
  its evolution, I will focus on the impacts of population on quality of life while trying to avoid assumptions about which futures of our 
  species are most or least desirable. The discussion can be broken up along several spectra, of which we will examine effects on 
  individuals and effects on the whole population and on severity of the effects.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Work in progress (which is also true of the above, just a bit less so)...
</p>
<p>
  First, let's look at the effects of population size on the quality of life provided to an individual. If you have too few people, you 
  likely end up with a relatively less fulfilling life in the sense that one would expect a lower average quality of relationship 
  fulfillment. This is predominately due to the relative lack of other humans with whom to interact, which restricts your choices and 
  lowers the expected quality of interaction that results.
</p>
<p>
  Next, let's look at the effects of population size on the species as a whole. If you have too few people, you face in the extreme, the 
  existential risk of an extinction vortex, and in general, you face reduced robustness due to external pressures. If you have too many 
  people, you face in the extreme, risk of societal collapse due to resource mismanagement.
</p>
<p>
  Having a greater number of people with whom to interact will presumably increase one's quality of life to some point, and it will require 
  the resources of the system to be split among more individuals, requiring each individual to have a smaller allocation of resources 
  available to oneself. So presumably, there is some optimal number of people that should exist in any system with finite resources (e.g. 
  Earth). Since the optimal number is dependent on a myriad, perhaps infinite number of variables, I'll refrain from trying to come up with 
  a specific target or upper bound. As a lower bound, let's say that humans don't want humans to go extinct (I know that some individual 
  humans argue for human extinction, but this is not a commonly held belief) and therefore, we need enough genetic variation in our 
  population to prevent an extinction vortex.

  <em>2014-12-03</em>
</h3>
<p>
  I just attempted to write a blog entry in third person, complaining about how feminist and gender queer blog entries sometimes become 
  very dark. Generalizing the bleak, derogatory abyss of <insert links to unnecessarily negative blogs here>, you find articles ranging 
  from mild, that cast blame for how people feel when they're exposed to adversity, to vile articles, that blame others for existing as 
  they are (Or, if we try to look at them more positively: as in their very existence makes me feel bad about myself by comparison, not 
  because they are bad to exist, but because the world is unfair). They range from mopey yet fairly compassionate to people of various 
  identities () to predominately hateful and loathing (). The latter make me feel, perhaps unsurprisingly, hate-filled and loathsome. Here 
  was the start to that blog entry, and I really wanted to keep going, but it was just so hard. It's much easier to rant than it is to 
  write a constructive commentary on the nature of a discussion:
</p>
<p>
  Reading a number of feminist and LGBT centric blog posts over the past several years, most of them have the right idea, focusing on 
  awareness and empowerment of groups that have traditionally been underserved and underrepresented. The spirt of the movement seems to be 
  about empowering individuals to live life as they feel compelled to live. Certainly, we all want the freedom to experience the world and 
  interact with others in constructive, mutually beneficial ways, and some groups have been historically, systematically excluded from 
  flowing through society in that way. Emphasizing that fact is important, and should definitely continue to take center stage until it 
  becomes a reality. And, that's where it could end.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes it does end there. Occasionally, though, it continues into shall we say, darker realms, where negativity creeps in and people 
  are encouraged to feel that, simply because they are lucky, they are somehow inherently wrong or bad or evil. Recognizably, usually, the 
  intent of these darker facets is to further the awareness of less well-know societal aspects by prompting the readers to self-examine and 
  analyze how they personally affect and are affected by groups with whom they may otherwise have considered only briefly. This is 
  reasonable, and it can be done in a more positive way. For example, it works to to tell stories where the reader identifies with the 
  primary actor and in which the primary actor goes through a transformative experience in relation to the subject matter. Alternatively, 
  direct questions and answers based on personal experience are a good way to provide perspective. Do you know anyone who is homosexual? 
  Have you ever thought about what it would be like to be physically intimate with someone in order to share a human experience, even if 
  that person is different from you in ways of which you have little understanding? Have you ever tried or even considered being someone 
  you just met and who compulsively repulses you because of who they are? Are you repulsed because that's who you are, or are you repulsed 
  because you have yet to fathom who they are?

  And still, we are so different that any union is sure to be rife with compromises. Big important compromises: children, career,

  Is it biology, physiology or psychology? Is it romance, magic or something else?

  I think for me it's balance. Being able to respect and identify with another competent, rational, intelligent human being and share our 
  observations, thoughts and interpretations having them be different, even mutually exclusive, and yet still valid to each individual 
  separately. Having the divergence be so close to the core, the most desirable, passionate relationships are inherently the most 
  problematic. Hopefully I'm just too young and have yet to discover true love, something similar yet simpler.

  I'm making this into a public diary. It is not a blog. It is for me. It's public, perhaps selfishly, for me as well. Because I want to 
  live without secrets, it is for me, my freedom.
</p>
<p>The below content was written a few months ago and is unrelated to the above decision.</p>
<p>
  I received my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering from UW Madison in 2010. Still trying to develop life goals, I worked at 
  Epic in the Technical Services role for 2.8 years where I gained a wonderful respect and appreciation for technology's ability to 
  transform entire sectors of the economy. In order to pursue a greater understanding of software and business, I left Epic and started 
  work at EatStreet.com, a Madison startup creating an internet ordering platform for independent local restaurants and small chains. 
  Currently, I do freelance work for another pre-market venture aimed at helping accounting practices go paper-free, while also continuing 
  to learn and work at EatStreet.
</p>
<p>
  Passion for understanding others' ideas, community, equality and global human development motivates me far more than money, influence, 
  power and at times even more than relationships. At TEDx Madison 2014, I want to learn about and to try to understand other people's 
  motivations, ideas and experiences and how they relate to my own passions and motivations. If requested, I would happily want to put 
  together a talk on observations regarding current trends in the development of global human culture and society (diplomacy/international 
  law, economic and financial trends, language/housing/clothing/food, technology, health, education, etc.; basically an overview of - as a 
  species - where we've come from, where we are, and perhaps touching briefly on some places we might yet go); I would want to present it 
  if I thought it was good enough and if others validated that opinion.

  Choosing your relationships is largely considered a fundamental right in our society. True, this is not necessarily the case in other 
  cultures, but in the United States, you can marry, divorce, disown, disinherit, inherit, etc. pretty much at will. There are a few 
  notable exceptions: 1) you cannot choose to add to your family outside of the one living spouse per person rule (and in some states that 
  person still has to be of the opposite gender) and 2) acknowledgement of children is forcible under certain circumstances. These 
  circumstances disproportionately affect men, as physically, pregnancy disproportionately affects women.

  Sex should never, ever be tied directly with offspring unless it's someone's, and preferably multiple people's choice. Abortion should be 
  legal because a person's right to the pursuit of happiness through sexual pleasure should trump the state's right to protect the 
  potentiality of human life (context matters, so certainly there are other epochs when this is not true). Abortion should be legal right 
  now. But it's not.

  Somehow, the state still maintains that it has a vested interest in protecting the well being of a fetus, and that it's interest in doing 
  so increases as the fetus matures. This is probably wrong, but most people cannot yet see it that way; they don't want to see it. Why 
  does the state have a vested interest in protecting an unborn human? Presumably, we assume from a legal standpoint, reflecting societies 
  values, that human life is inherently valuable to the society, and therefore this makes sense. The value of the human life comes in many 
  forms - it's joyous and harmonious relationships to others, the contributions is makes to maintaining our species and our societal 
  structure, etc. I think we can all agree that human life is generally valuable in both quality and quantity. But, like anything, too much 
  is not good. If the planet were filled entirely with humans we couldn't move, we couldn't leave, and we would all pretty much get bored 
  and want to die. Economically, we probably want a population size that optimizes for both quantity and quality of life. At some point, we 
  don't want more people. What would be some good indicators that we have enough people? And at that point, does the government still have 
  a vested interest in protecting an unborn human? The answer is that we have a vested interest in agreeing to policy structures locally, 
  nationally, globally that help regulate the population in such a way that we generally all agree is mutually beneficial. This is 
  incredibly difficult. Ideally, we would not regulate, people would just have a small number of children, and thankfully, this happens 
  naturally to some extent.

<p>
  People are unjustifiably hubris when it comes to defending the nature of our species. We have failed before, and we will fail again. What 
  we can hope to achieve is to learn from our failures and lessen the magnitude of each one consecutively. In a way, that will happen when 
  we ruin our planet and or have a lasting catastrophic global depression sometime over the course of the next several decades. Let's 
  compare our global civilization to that of the Easter Islanders. We likely won't fail in the sense that we will all have to leave the 
  planet, because 1) we can't leave and because 2) extinction would require an incredibly extreme change of global climate, potentially 
  beyond the likes of climate change and/or nuclear war (though I would be interested in a well though-out counter claim). We will fail in 
  the sense that we're effectively lowering the carrying capacity of our planet in the long run and at a minimum we will undergo massive 
  penalties to the quality of life experienced by human beings across the globe, and potentially a sizable loss in the quantity of that 
  life as well.
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately, my point isn't that abortion should be legal - it should, but that's not my point really. My point is that it should be legal 
  so that we correctly balance our desire for quantity of life against our desire for quality of life. We want abortion to be legal, all 
  abortion. And, we want everyone to feel safe and secure about meeting their sexual needs. Let's legalize all abortion where it's someones 
  choice. Forward!

  Today sucked. I wasn't able to focus at work, partially because I was attempting to do things that are fairly boring like write and 
  validate unit tests for a bunch of old xml endpoints, and partially because I was distracted by my incessant desire to feel in control. 
  Grams asked me recently if I felt in control of my life and I just sort of laughed. I think that I would have said yes until about six or 
  nine months ago. It's still quite a strange question, what is control. Our understanding of the universe seems to be that things are 
  largely determined by the nature of random details, and that control is largely an abstract illusion. Even when I know what I want, why I 
  want it, and approximately how to get it, I can fail to actually act toward what I want, or I can be distracted or realize that maybe I 
  don't want it after all. Worst of all, you can end up getting either something you didn't plan for that is perceived as negative (this 
  made me cry today - http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-hardest-thing-you-have-ever-done) or you can get something that you explicitly 
  planned against.
