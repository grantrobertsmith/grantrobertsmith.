  <i>No... No... Oh, she's cute... but she put her height, so even though she's an inch shorter than I am, she probably won't think I'm 
  tall enough... Ok, this one looks familiar... I just can't seem to place her...</i> As Jacob tried to recall how he knew this Tinder lady 
  named "Jynx," his secretary rang.
</p>
<p>
  "Your ten o'clock, Ditya, from the island's Department of Commerce is here. I know she's early, but should I send her in?" inquired 
  James, Jacob's secretray and personal administrative assistant.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Fuck, "Jynx" was that bitch Ditya who recently took over as Bali's head of commercial affairs for the regional government.</i> "Please 
  have her wait until the scheduled time. Thanks, James!" Jacob stood up to walk around the room and relax himself a bit. <i>She'll just be 
  wanting the traditional payoffs. This shouldn't be anything special.</i>
</p>

  Pacing the room, Jacob was having a harder time relaxing than he usually would. He couldn't help jumping between the images he'd just 
  seen of a potential romanitic partner and the cold, calculating eyes he remembered from his first encounter with Ditya. When she was 
  still campaigning a few months ago, James had held a private panel discussion with the three front-running candidates at one of this 
  luxury hotels in Ubud. He recalled her saying that she felt like the island could use more organization and stronger governmental 
  standards for managing the flux of tourists in and out of the island, which sounded ominous for a man running a large assortment of 
  hotels, casinos, entertainment companies and other attractions.
