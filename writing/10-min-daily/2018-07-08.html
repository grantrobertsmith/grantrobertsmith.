Originally I planned to focus exclusively on overpopulation, population control, population tragets and the like. However, I'm finding it
difficult to think up new content on that topic every day. This is especially true when spend all of my time focusing on other topics these

my biological daughter, Keira. We went to the pool, played a few small pretend games, both with toys and completely imaginary - one
involved making each other into human burritos and then eating each other. It was fun in all. Also, rather than try to stay on topic, I'm
about to relax into a completely stream of consciousness writing style, my apologies for
