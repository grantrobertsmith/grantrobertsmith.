  I almost forgot to write anything at all. Let's see... I ended up people watching on the ride up to Berkeley rather than working on ideas 
  for my story outline or reading. Then once I got here, we didn't really talk about sci-fi or writing at all because we jumped straight 
  into a new Time Stories campaign. This was reasonably fun, but the result is that I didn't acheive much in the way of creativity. Still, 
  today was pretty good overall. I ran in the morning and got work done and stayed focused on the things around me. I've felt a bit down 
  for no paritcularly obvious nor fair reason the past few hours. It hasn't been in a way that really mattered since I kept busy and had 
  fun with life all the same. It could have to do with the likely job shift coming up and the notion that I'll be working there for quite a 
  while most likely, and that there are a number of slightly risky tradeoffs in making the move, which combined with the financial 
  worsening, particularly in light of my current employer's offer to let me work fully remote, makes this seem like a much less obvious 
  play to make.

  I guess I should talk it over with a few more people at this point. I'm a bit confused about what I "should" be doing with this decision. 
  On one hand, working at the intersection of government and healthcare on an Epidimiology product seems correct (as opposed to a travel 
  loans product); on the other hand, it does seem kind of dumb to sacrefice $1,250 per month of net income, plus stock options, which is 
  what I'd be doing by taking the job on the public health product. Ugh...
