  Things I did for work today: spent way to much time trying to fix the off by one date issue with loan and application searches in ops 
  portal and with the tests after the actual searches were fixed, interviews, answering people's questions (I feel like I'm doing ever more 
  of that lately), and - for other work - attended the Public Health 101 lecture. Things I did for not work: went for a walk, ate dope 
  sushi at Koma Sushi (I really wish I had discovered the greatness of that place sooner.), drafted an email to Anne and Angela and talked 
  to Maria about it, got my journal entry done. Things I didn't get done but could and/or should have: logistics for tomorrow and this 
  weekend, the short story.
