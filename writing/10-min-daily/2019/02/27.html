  Typically when you think about expanding your comfortzone, is it doing a large, emotionally challenging, one time thing? What are the 
  elememnts of an activity that make it qualify as comfort zone stretching or expanding? Maybe it just has to feel uncomfortable, but 
  that alone probably wouldn't get someone to want to do it. The activity also needs to be desireable - it needs to have potential 
  reward. And on the flip side, the thing that makes it uncomfortable in the first place is likely that there is potential risk of downside 
  in the event of failure or perceived failure.

  But what if you think about breaking a habbit or forming a new habbit as comfort zone expansion? It seems to share a lot of these 
  characteristics. For example, say you want to work out every day. Or, maybe you work out, but you always do it in the evening after work 
  and you want to start doing it first thing in the morning. In either case, you risk failing to break the old habbit or to form the new 
  habbit, which is the perceived failure. You are probably trying the new thing because there is benefit or potential benefit. And, making 
  the leap to change or ingrain a habbit will almost certainly feel uncomfortable at first. In fact, altering a habbit is likely to be more 
  difficult than doing a one-time activity that is outside of your comfort zone. It would be closer to expanding your comfortzone in an 
  area where you need to really practice to make the expansion count. For example, public speaking or dating are probably going to take many 
  more individual attempts to become comfortable than will riding a roller coaster or rock climbing.

  It might be interesting to take techniques that apply to one area and directly or, by generalizing, inderectly apply those techniques to 
  the other area: forming a habbit versus expanding your comfort zone.
