  The main idea is that Bali was taken over completely by the tourism industry around 2015 on the a side in a traditional capitalist sense, 
  and with augmentative AI nets coming out around 2035, the island's head of commerce decides to consolidate the island's power players 
  using government authority in order to reap traditional benefits like bribes and whatnot. The story takes place before and after she gets 
  the procedure. The story focuses on her as an anti-hero, and her antagonists are the head of the company with whom she works and plays 
  off of romantically in order to trick him into getting control of basically the whole island. She is also opposed by the national 
  government and by cultural and environmental groups (both reasonable ones and extremists). These groups are represented by a nice lady in 
  one of the reasonable, culturally-focused groups.

  Opening exposition focuses on main character meeting with head of main tourism partner and devising a plan to consolidate the tourism 
  industry by creating an unpopular but still tenable plan to preserve more of the traditional cultural and environmental aspects of the 
  island which have long been ignored. Scene also develops romantic interest between the two.

  Next, the anti-hero meets with the national government, which is even more pro the plan even though the international community is more 
  monied and more interested in continued stability of foreign capital's influence on Bali's emmense tourism industry. The island is almost 
  entirely covered in attractions of every variety from casinos to monolithic shopping centers to rides and games and virtual experiences. 
  There are still parks, but in an unbalanced sense from the perspective of the reader.

  She get's the AI-connectivity implant and become a total sociopath (she was nearly a complete sociopath to begin with, but now she 
  definitely is.)
</p>
<p>
  Plan to fake appease the environmentalists and national government is completed successfully.

<p>
  Two main characters work together with international support to "liberate" Bali from indonesia (even though there are very, very few 
  native Balinese folks left on the island), and they promptly reverse all plans and work on the environmental/cultural front.
</p>
<p>
  Anti-hero betrays the business man in order to continue seeking additional power by getting into bed with a larger influencer on the 
  international playing field. Using this connection, she aims to leave Bali behind personally in order to get a seat at the table at the 
  UN or whatever the important international force is (maybe it's an economic union of large businesses).
