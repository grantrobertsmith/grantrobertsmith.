  I'm not sure how many pickles I ate today. I mostly just worked and got things done. Seemed fairly focused. At work I gave an interview, 
  finished updating the ops firewall for agna endpoints to cancel loan, export loan, export aa docs and export loan docs. I also fixed ops 
  svc and portal code so that exporting aa docs works correctly. I made a ticket for finishing the export loans functionality migration, 
  which I did already for xml export but not for the nls import part, which I removed from the agna ops portal code but which probably 
  still has to be used by batch processes and scripts. I'm not really sure if there is a specific reason for migrating that functionality 
  out of ops service and the clojure libraries and into the agna service, so I probably will just not do that at all for now. So, I created 
  a ticket for migrating the sms functionality instead. Outside of work, I finalized stuff with Sunquest. I let Vic know, and I catalogued 
  my todos and wrote this journal. Now I have to "exercise" still, and then I need to floss and brush my teeth and sleep.
