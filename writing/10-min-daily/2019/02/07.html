  Hmmmmmmm... I should really be writing journal entries AND something creative but alas, it's not happening again tonight. Today I had a 
  slightly uncomfortable chat with Rob, who's a good guy, but the chat was a waste of both our time and we both knew it. That statement's a 
  bit harsh, as was one I made today without really filtering it, when he said, "you'll be missed." And I responded with, "I'll miss you 
  too; well, not you specifically. I don't really know you." Which is true and all, but of course what I meant to say and should have said 
  was, "I'll miss people here too." Anyway, that was a miss but not the end of the world. Other than that, I called and set up an 
  appointment to talk with Anne's lawyer, and I chatted with Gwen and John and Carl and got some documentation from them. So, I was 
  productive out of work, and in work I was productive in terms of interviewing 2 folks, having some productive chats, cleaning up a few 
  small code things, and getting started on two tasks, one of which (migrating the sms send functionality to use agna) was depriorized and 
  the other which was upped in priority (making sure all of the old write endpoints worked with the agna version of the data being passed 
  around the client).
