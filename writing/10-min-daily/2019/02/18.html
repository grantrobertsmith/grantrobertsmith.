  Went to Death Valley National Park this weekend with B. Feaster, Ruchira, Rachel and Pavan this weekend, and had a great time. The salt 
  flats and topography (montain's, valley, dunes, etc.) reminded me a lot of Atacama. I think the biggest difference is the valley itself, 
  which at Atacama isn't really a thing (the salt flats are just part of a larger desert there. The mountains around death valley also seem 
  to be steeper with fewer random rock formations standing alone in a vast expanse like existed in the Atacama area. I ended up needing to 
  purchase a new camp stove, fuel and food for the first night, most of which went unused since we ended up bailing on the second night of 
  camping as well as focusing on restaurants for our source of nutrients. Now I have a bunch of dehydrated food to use up over the next two 
  weeks before I take of from the Bay Area for an indeterminent length of time. Maybe I can give whatever's left to Brian. I could see him 
  at least potentially using it. I could also ask Rachel, or Mike Sullivan might want it.
