  Out of work today, I did a lot of prep for this weekend and Tuesday evening, walked but not ran 5k and got rid of excess shirts. At work 
  I helped Shivani and Gopal get up to speed a bit on things I'll be handing off that we're working on currently, and I did a bit of Agna 
  bug fixing. I wrote about Uplift culture. So all and all, this week in work was Agna, intervewing, preparing to leave, and the status quo 
  maintenance work around pledging and some production servicing issues. Outiside of work was mostly preping for the new job (includes 
  dealing with dumb legal system stuff).
