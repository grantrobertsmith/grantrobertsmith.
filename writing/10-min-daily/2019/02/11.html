  I have done well so far with the avoiding indulgences part of today (and yesterday), but I didn't write creatively yesterday. Work went 
  well and I got in a run that I wasn't expecting. I did two interviews, finished isolating the functionality for the soft launch of ops 
  portal version agna, worked on the pledging by per loan grade prinicpal balance outstanding cap, and made some other minor agna ops user 
  interface bug fixes. I also have yet to write creatively today. Late last night I watched a decent TEDx talk called "The Super Mario 
  Effect"; it probably applies most to me in terms of relationships :P (and maybe - ;) - creative writing).
