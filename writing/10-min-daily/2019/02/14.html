  So, I feel like a bunch of things went down today, mostly outside of the office: planning for parties this weekend, tonight, and next 
  week at the Hacker House, finishing up the email to Anne and Angela and talking with my parents about it, running five miles, and my life 
  coaching session with Molly. At the office, I did another interview, I troubleshot things with PFSC and with agna, and I helped people 
  with random stuff. Okay, so when I reflect on work today, it could probably have been more productive than it was, but I had a hard time 
  staying focused with how tired I am and with all the non-work stuff that I had to think about and deal with.
