  Let's see, I still have to walk/run today. I got up kind of early, and did more tinder messaging than normal, but I don't really care 
  about that. Then I went into work a bit earlier than usual, had a meh interview at one point and generally worked a decent amount but 
  only got an okay amount of stuff done, including a number of small bug fixes, blocking the write operations in agna version of ops for 
  safety reasons, and correcting the rest of the things that I could correct. I saved the book I need to read as a pdf and made it 
  available on my phone. I don't really have anything else to say here about today. Oh, yeah, I rewrote the answer to my own interview 
  question, but that was easy and a bit boring since it had already happened.
