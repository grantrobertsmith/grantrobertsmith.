  So as far as avoiding temptations goes, today was a bad day. On the other hand, I did laundry, finished a bunch of logistical stuff, am 
  writing and ran 5 miles, so all of that is good. I ate Swedish fish and I played a lot of chess, which were bad. I read some of Storm 
  Tomes - if I'm rememberint the title correctly. The writing feels ameture-ish, but overall it's not bad. And, I'm imagining that there 
  will be some real life comentary in it eventually, so hopefully there's a bit of that to make me think about later on. I still need to 
  talk to Keira, so hopefully Anne gets back to me tomorrow about that. I think I'll run 5 miles again tomorrow. I also want to get most of 
  that 1k words written; actually, I just realized that I can't remember the exact amount of words I said. I'm sure it wasn't more than 5k 
  total and 1.5k for the first checkpoint, so let's go with those numbers and say 1.5k words tomorrow. Other possible todos include reading 
  more of Storm Tomes, reading some Atlas Medical Material and working on UpLift tasks. In particular there is enabling the edit account 
  button/functionality, which I think should make the official todo list: enable edit profile button, run 5M, talk to Keira, write 1.5k 
  words toward short story, write journal entry, no chess/hanabi, no candy/soda/sweets; optional: read a chapter or two of Storm Tomes, 
  read some of the Sunquest material. Forgot to mention playing D&D which was cool too today.

  Also, had cool idea about using Tinder to just meet a new person irl each day (or most days). Probably not a thing for the immediate 
  future, but perhaps come March 4th, I can remake my profile and start doing it that way.
