  So, I am massively behind now on the short story writing goal for Thursday, but that's fine because I can just do it all tomorrow night, 
  right? Anyway, today's focus was good and I didn't totally fail any goal (except the writing one). I'm really tired so I don't feel like 
  enumerating the work-related tasks I checked off, but I guess I'll try anyway: sent an official resignation letter and responded to Rob's 
  request for idealistic work-culture descriptions, fixed some agna things, finished the rough version of the psfc change and outlined the 
  design for the harder version, scripted deploy for ui ops, and maybe some other stuff that I'm forgetting. I went to dinner at Birddog 
  with Rachel and Pavan, and I liked the food a lot, but the atmosphere was a bit annoying at the bar because it was so loud and we were 
  seated linearly so it was difficult for Rachel and I to hear each other and for either of us to hear Pavan when he was talking towards 
  either one of us but not the other. Went on a slow, short run with Simon, which is fine given that I'm worried about my shin splints 
  coming back.
