  Went to a career fair today. It was pretty fun to meet a bunch of young aspiring contributors to society. One of them even asked for 
  advice on majors based on what employers are looking for, which was great. Today ended up being pretty busy overall with that and with 
  the agna being merged and deployed to production snafu. Besides those things, working out this morning was a failure, which is probably 
  for the best since my foot is a bit sore still from last night, and I can just go for a walk now instead after I finish writing this. I 
  overall like my goals and my direction. I like the habit of writing that I've gotten into. I like that I'm actually working with someone 
  on developing an exercise habit rather than trying to do that all on my own. I like my prioritization in life overall. Getting older is 
  already a bit noticeably shitty, but I guess not so bad yet and besides, it's not like I'm planning to try to stop the process. I've 
  never really sated my sex-drive, but at this point I'm pretty meh on changing that. I have nothing else to say currently other than I do 
  need to start penning this story rather than just thinking about it, and when I do think about it, it needs to be in the context of at 
  least penning those thoughts.
