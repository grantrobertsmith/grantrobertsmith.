<p>
  I ate way to much, and then I ran and somehow I still didn't vomit, so that was good, I guess. Overall, today was a pretty good day. I 
  got up and got into the office at a reasonable time, stayed pretty focused and productive while there and all the way up through getting 
  to the gate to wait for the plane. Even after that I feel like me behaviors were balanced enough, though I still played online chess 
  despite the fact that such behavior offers me basically no long term benefit and the short term benefit could aslo have been gained by 
  just sitting and thinking or reading or writing or playing some other game that I don't know as well. Still, I guess I am able to get 
  better at chess if I actually focus and keep track of patterns in my mistakes and successes. Let's see, oh yeah, I finished the day be 
  keeping my habitual commitments, reading and working out (and of course flossing and brushing my teeth). Now I just have to go to sleep 
  without staying up to late playing games and fucking up the goodness at winning life that I have going on right now despite the 
  repedative use of the word spite and the not doing "creative" writing and the this being a horribly worded runnon sentence and all. 
  Peace!
