  Reporting on my daily and weekly activities is good and all, but it would be nice to share more interesting thoughts from time to time 
  too, or even if not more interesting, I truely enjoy consistently focusing on my deepest desires, so rewriting them more frequently 
  sounds fun and worthwhile internally, even if any potential reader of this content is annoyed, my apologies. Creative writing is a vessel 
  for sharing my utopia in an endless search for establishing shared utopia on Earth and ultimately everywhere. That's all for now :)

  I did a separate session of creative writing this morning that went alright. It seems more focused, fluid, prolific and unfettered by the 
  weight of the day's efforts than when I procrastinate into the evening. It's also allowed me this time now to focus on a journal entry 
  instead of thinking they ought to be either or things. At work, I spent a decent amount of time with Malika, bringing her up to speed as 
  a new employee and contributer to the Agna project. She seems promising. I interviewed a promising recent grad. I reenabled a couple more 
  functional buttons on the agna version of the ops portal, I did some bug investigation, and in the morning I finished up the powerpoint 
  that I was working on. Gopal gave me some good feedback and did a nice job of cleaning up one of my slides.

  The closer I get to actually leaving Uplift, the sadder it becomes. Wayne finding out just today apparently, which still surprises me, 
  was sad, and Alex said he wanted the front end to be part of my going away event, which is touching, given that I'm not even on that 
  team. Still, I look forward to the new job, the new team, the travel, and I expect to see folks around here in the future from time to 
  time as I come back to the Bay Area to visit while working remotely. I'm also looking forward to seeing Harry again before I leave, same 
  with dinner with Sully tomorrow, Mari on Friday and other dinners next week. I'm even looking forward to the call with Chelsea, the 
  lawyer, tomorrow. I should get some sleep, now that I've said what I came here to say; that way, I'll be awake and ready for that call.
