  I wonder what the creative process is like for other people. My friend Ted suggested that I map out the whole arc of the story before I 
  start trying to tell it. This tends to be how I would do things naturally anyway, and it feels like the simplest, most straight-forward 
  way to go about it in my mind, but I could see being of a mind to let events unfold naturally from start to finish, not necessarily 
  knowing where things are going as the story leads you there. Unfortunately, my mind has these pesky things called "goals," which dictate 
  the where and therefore lend themselves to mapping out everything before beginning, since there is a destination charted ahead of time. 
  It seems like the best thing to do now is create a timeline of events and fill that in and then to develop the characters around the 
  events (something like worldview begetting goals begetting ideas begetting events begetting characters). The other way to do it is 
  probably roughlt the reverse of that.

  So, I have goals and some ideas and a few events. I need to create a working document for tracking the ideas and events and shaping them 
  into a story and crafting that narrative and filling it with characters. Sounds like [work/fun]. Enjoy!
