  I really don't feel like writing now, so I'm going to do another cop out entry where I just stream my thoughts for 10 minutes. This one's 
  going to be a bit more complain-y than usual. First, I'm tired, and I haven't been sleeping particularly well lately. I don't really know 
  why. Besides that, I visited Keira today, which was a lot of fun, especially playing in the snow and sledding, but this probably 
  contributes to my current tiredness. It also relates to bigger complain-y thing number one: conversing with Keira's mom. It's not going 
  well lately / not really a thing at all. We had a couple arguments a few times ago (I only see Keira, and therefore her mom, once a 
  month.), and since then, she hasn't even really been conversational at all, whereas before that she would tell me about how things were 
  in her life. I have guesses as to why this is, but I don't really know. Also, it seems like if I asked, she'd probably not give the real 
  answer as to why it is this way, but that too is mostly a hunch. Complain-y thing number two is probably just frustration with myself the 
  past couple of weeks playing lots of games and not being particularly productive despite having quite a bit of time on my hands. Meh. And 
  complain-y thing number three is my job. It's fine, I just wish it were better because I've gotten more fulfillment and enjoyment out of 
  past jobs.
