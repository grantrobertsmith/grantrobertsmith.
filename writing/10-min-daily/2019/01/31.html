  It legit feels really good to accomplish goals. I imagine that people with the acheivement strength from StrengthFinder testing would get 
  a bigger high out of it than average, and more than I do. Along the lines of diary stuff (since the first couple sentences here were 
  motivated by the life coaching meaning that I had this morning), still feeling good about spending time with family over the past weekend 
  and beginning of this week. On my todo list I have the story outline, reaching out to Anne's lawyer, having tough conversations at work, 
  and contacting people this weekend: Keira & Lauren. Now in this next paragraph, I'm going to put ideas for the short story, I think I'll 
  take the black mirror concept I had in that other day about an isolated community that was dominated by an AI enhanced individual with 
  heavily greedy, hedonistic, borderline (if not completely) sociopathic tendencies.

  And, I didn't get to this last night, so I'll get to it tonight. Obviously that means it's on a different page. Also, Kevin already left 
  great feedback which I'm looking forward to reviewing; woot!!!
