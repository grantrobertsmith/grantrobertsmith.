  I'll probably, actually keep this one to ten minutes just because it's late and I'm tired. It's really my own fault for doing nothing all 
  day, and by nothing I mean continuing to play copious amounts of overcooked. But, as was said many time, "I'm on vacation." This is true, 
  though I'm unsure if it makes a legitimate excuse for my behavior. I think there's be a better arguement around that prospect if it were 
  not for the fact that I haven't been working overly hard otherwise. (I'm saying that I don't really <em>need</em> a vacation.) Perhaps 
  I'm being too harsh on myself. I had been doing pretty well until last week, and the holidays do make things more difficult in terms of 
  being productive at work because there are so many people out of the office. Standards by myself for myself shouldn't have anythign to do 
  with other people though.

  It was swell seeing Corey today. I really miss the freedom I had working fully remote and being able to live whereever I pleased, 
  including and especially when I moved to a new city every few months. Now I have a pretty strong income though, so I could travel every 
  other weekend if I really wanted. Heck, I could maybe even travel every weekend, but that could get tiring, and it would prevent me from 
  saving, which seems bad. When I'm saving in order to travel later, the immediate reward of travelling makes far less sense. The payoff is 
  less when it's so time-limited, and the cost to value ratio is worse.

  I'll probably have to actually do things tomorrow. Maybe I should take some time to think about what I need to accomplish Wednesday and 
  the rest of this week before nodding of... nah!
