  "I'm sorry Ms. Hudges, but the technology is too young." Svetlana felt as though she were listening to a child who's first words were, 
  "Too young."

  Dr. Danes was a prodigious coneurology expert fresh off his residency at Mayo. At age 12 he published his first article in <i>The Lancet 
  Neurology</i>. It was picked up by <i>Nature</i>, and eventually he became the first teenager to earn Time Magazine's Person of the Year 
  Award. Though for someone as celebrated as he was, Dr. Danes maintained a sort of poised aloofness that kept him within the defined 
  limits for a standard physician's arrogance.

  "Look, Dr. Danes, I understand perfectly the limitations of the merge as it relates to children. I've read all of the papers including 
  yours. I know the risks. I know the odds. I still want to give Jessica the chance to grow up," repeated Svetlana for what felt like the 
  millionth time. "Plus, with good luck, there are huge upsides for both of us," she argued.

  Conscious merging technology had been commercially available for few years, but everyone understood that children could not be 
  meaningfully merged with adults becaue of the significant differences in neurological development. However, there had been recent work in 
  a few private Chinese labs that showed promise in overwriting an adult brain with the functional equivalent of a child's. Svetlana hoped 
  that Dr. Danes's ego would push him to try the procedure on her and her terminally ill daughter.

  Ms. Hudges was desperate to give her daughter Jessica any chance to live no matter how unlikely. Jessica had been Svetlana's life since 
  she was born four years ago. When Jessica was diagnosed with SMA at six months old, Svetlana spent countless nights pouring over every 
  bit of literature she could find about the disease. There were a number of promising treatment options, but none of them seemed to help 
  her daughter. By the time Jessica was one, Svetlana had already started reaching for alternatives as unorthodox as voodoo and cryonics.

  "I've been thinking about those upsides, Ms. Hudges, but there are risks for me too," he replied. "If the procedure fails, I'll lose 
  credibility, and in the worst case, I could even lose my license to practice." He stood up to pace behind his desk for a moment.
</p>
<p>
  This was more hesitancy than Svetlana could recall having seen in her previous conversations with the doctor, and she decided to seize 
  the moment, "You mentioned the window between when we scan my consicousness for storage and when we overwrite my brain to make room for 
  Jessica. There would be anywhere from hours to days in which I'm creating memories we'd both know are temporary. Can you think of any way 
  to take advantage of that?"
