  So, here I am again. Another day without having put time into being "productive". I did spend some time thinking about the universe that 
  I want to craft, and I spent some time practicing interview computer science questions, so I guess the former 'sigh' isn't completely 
  accurate, but I failed to actually write something of a creative nature, which is really the kicker at this point. I'm reasonably 
  comfortable now just sitting down to spew semi-intelligible dribble into the editor, but I'm not at all comfortable when the nature of 
  said dribble shifts from diary-type non-fiction to creative fiction. Maybe I should take the intermediate step of spewing the creative 
  fiction without really thinking or caring much how it sounds. It seems potentially worthwhile and therefore worth a try at minimum.
