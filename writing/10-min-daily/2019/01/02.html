  I should really just use other people's promts to start writing fiction or some up with a list of my own and use those: exploring in a 
  jungle while looking for an ancient and powerful artifact; having a conversation about whether or not aliens exist; fighting a pack of 
  veloceraptors; going bungie jumping through time (whatever that means); learning to play violin; joining a circus and performing under 
  the big top and in parades. It doesn't really matter, but writing about anything fictional would be more productive than sitting here for 
  ten minutes trying to piece together a grand epic without ever putting down a single word. That isn't exactly what happens most of the 
  time, but there could certainly be more balance going forward.
