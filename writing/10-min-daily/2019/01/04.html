  Even though they'd been together for years, Jeremy felt like he was meeting her for the first time. "Wow, you used to like ponies a lot."
</p>
<p>
  "Don't you mean <em>we</em> used to like ponies a lot? Or even, <em>I</em>?" she smiled.
</p>
<p>
  "Yeah, I guess, but <em>I</em> didn't grow up liking ponies, that was you. I grew up liking dinosaurs and spaceships and cars. You know, 
  like a normal dude."
</p>
<p>
  Jennifer realized it was going to be a long haul getting used to their new situation, but she didn't realize she was going to have to 
  sweat the small stuff.
</p>
<p>
  <i>What do you mean small stuff? Oh... well, I'm glad I'll just get <strong>my</strong> way then.</i>
</p>
<p>
  "We know that's not what was meant," she said flattly.
</p>
<p>
  "I just meant about the way I think about our past," Jeremy replied.
</p>
<p>
  <i><strong>And</strong> you meant about our pronouns. <strong>I</strong></i>, she held up her hands together and parted them by moving 
  her right to the right while leaving her left directly in front of her, <i>is only for our current state.</i>
</p>
<p>
  Jeremy was already getting irked and tired. <i>This feels schitzophrenic.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Well yeah. They said it probably would. Wasn't Jeremy expecting it.</i> And without meaning to, she added the thought, <i>Or didn't he 
  plan ahead much.</i> She and they both knew he didn't.
</p>
<p>
  "Rude." <i>Anyway, now Jeremy's even smarter than Jenny ever was.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>More like Janey is, but yeah.</i>
</p>
<p>
  Jeremy felt a bit indignent about this particular correction of fact, which Janey smugly ignored. But because Jeremy was fully aware of 
  Janey, he – well, she, really – felt even more indignent. This cycle of indignation and smugness built up briefly before Janey realized 
  how incredibly silly it was to be having any such internal standoff. At the same time, she realized that using the name Jeremy at all was 
  equally silly <i>unless <strong>I</strong> am specifically thinking about my <strong>Jeremy</strong> past. Better?!</i> There was a lot 
  of indignation.
</p>
<p>
  <i>I have really got to pull myself together. Can we <strong>please</strong> think of ourself in the plural for a while? How about using 
  both pural and singular for a while, but trying to use the singular more and more? How about whatever comes naturally? How about the 
  trying to acclimate to the words that make sense in the long run? Pronouns are mostly social norms anyway – looks like Jenny thought 
  about that quite a bit at one point.<i>
</p>
<p>
  Janey was exhausted by the constant internal debate. She needed a rest, and everyone knew it. She sat down again and rubbed her temples 
  while trying hard not to think of anything. <i>Thank god Jeremy practiced the techniques on the checklist – sorry, sorry, sorry, no 
  thinking. My bad; all good.</i>
</p>
<p>
  "Are you alright?" asked the lanky monitor.
</p>
<p>
  "Yeah, we... I'm <em>fine</em>," Janey snapped back. "Sorry, I didn't mean to sound that way, it's just a lot more frustrating that I was 
  expecting, and my thoughts are racing, and I need some time to settle down before I really try to sort things out. And, the fundamentals 
  just <em>can't</em> come first. I don't know why I thought they could, but there's so much simpler shit to wade through first. Stuff pops 
  up immediately, and it's natural to try to address it, but who knows if it makes any sense to address it?! It's like having two or three 
  different people in my head even when we all know it <em>should</em> be just one."
</p>
<p>
  The lanky man just gaped at the torrent of words. By contrast, the meek lady seemed captivated: "Wow, that does sound intense."
</p>
<p>
  "Yeah, it is."
</p>
<p>
  <i>I feel like we need to be sedated, but I obviously shouldn't say that out loud.</i>
</p>
<p>
  "I just need to focus on how important this is and how much I want to make it work and on how much I love Janey and Jeremy and Jenny," 
  Janey said to reassure the monitors. <i>Actually, the same sentiment is pretty reassuring to me too,</i> she reflected.

  Other topics for later:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Why was 'like of ponies' the first thought?
    </li>
    <li>
      Oh... well, I'm glad I'll just get my way then. <-- This elipsis has to be addressed. It has to do with compromising in the merged 
      state, which is a big deal (and a big topic).
    </li>
    <li>
      Pronouns are mostly social norms anyway – looks like Jenny thought about that quite a bit at one point.
    </li>
    <li>
      And, the fundamentals just <em>can't</em> come first. I don't know why I thought they could...
    </li>
    <li>
      ... but I obviously shouldn't say that out loud. <-- probably because she wants everyone to think it's going fairly well (for a 
      number of different reasons: more faith in the process, more faith in her, being sedated is just less efficient in dealing with the 
      issues that are all over the place, etc.)
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Other things to keep in mind:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Jeremy doesn't plan ahead much.
    </li>
    <li>
      I feel like I need to be sedated. <-- Where does this thought come from? The situation obviously, but probably have it be specific to 
      one of their pasts.
    </li>
  </ul>
