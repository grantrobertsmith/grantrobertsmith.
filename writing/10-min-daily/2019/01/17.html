  I think I'll keep this short and non-fictional and be okay with it as a consolation for doing nebulous interview prep for tomorrow. The 
  interview is a sort of technical discussion interview I suppose, where I'll likely talk a lot about my career history and anser those 
  silly behavior type questions. I'm sure I'll also get to discuss technical projects that I've designed and/or worked on. Likely I'll find 
  out more about what the position offers and end up in a position to do a cost benefit analysis from my side. They should get a rough idea 
  of my skills and experiences and what I'm looking for in my next position. I guess since I don't see the job as clearly a ton superior, 
  and because a rejection wouldn't take as much out of me emotional as a lot of other job seeking experiences I've had have (or as much as 
  some other current and future potential rejections would), I feel pretty good about the situation.
