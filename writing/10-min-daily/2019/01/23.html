  Game on! She jumped on top of me and started kissing my neck. Smut must be the easiest genre of fiction. You literally just write out 
  your fantasies and assume that other people have similar interest. Descrition is key. I guess I could do that sometime, but it also seems 
  like poor practice for real thought provoking fiction. Though, not necessarily, since you can write smut that also contains interesting 
  ideas. Ok, so iirc, one of the ideas was daughter going to die but merges with mom instead. I think I'll explore that one next.
