  I just played too much chess. I feel like there has to be something to deal with habbit forming goals as opposed to simple acheivement 
  based goals. I've procrastinated a lot. I think I'm probably going to just use all of tomorrow as an off day to finish and send of these 
  pieces that I want people to look at.
