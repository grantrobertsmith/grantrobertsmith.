  I've worked myself up a bit at this point to where I'm pretty excited that I might get this job offer. I'm trying to contain the fact too 
  that something random could come up or I could get beat out by another candidate at the last minute. It was a bit weird today that they 
  asked if I were planning to relocate to Tucson, since I already conveyed my residency plans in the interview, but that could just be a 
  communcation issue between the people that interviewed me and HR. It could also be an issue with making the offer in the sense that the 
  offer could reasonably be calculated based on the city in which I'm living. Either way I am really interested to find out what happens 
  next. I just hope I'm not disappointed if it ends up not working out.
