  For some reason I decided to do practice interview problems rather than to write or read. This seems okay I guess. Certainly it's better 
  than standard triggered desires like games. Oh well... :( Yeah, I'm not even going to stream thoughts to words because I feel like just 
  doing that to do it for 10 minutes doesn't particularly grow my abilities to write at this point. I have to step it up for it to really 
  count and be worth it.
