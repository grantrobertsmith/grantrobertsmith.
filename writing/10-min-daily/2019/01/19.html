  "Come quick, someone's entered the secret passage in the middle of Town Square again!" rang a high-pitched voice from the street.
</p>
<p>
  The crowd of gnomes and elves poured past Max and Alyssa and out of the Potent Potion Inn on their way to see the standard excitement. 
  While they had only just shipped into Grimmauld, Max and Alyssa had encountered strange complacency toward what were apparantly constant 
  heist attempts of the local legend's vault.
</p>
<p>
  That local legend's name was Grimmon. His stony likeness on a statue in the center of Town Square emanated as much feeling as gazing upon 
  the fleshy version of the face the sculpture was modeled after - that is to say, none at all. Over the years, Grimmon aged in the ways 
  that makes a gnome hard, inside and out. His once bright eyes greyed over with the wisdom of knowing his own superiority could deal with 
  any and every threat he might face. While this provided Grimmon the leisure of disposing the uncommon, successful tresspasser in 
  accordance with his daily whim, it left the regular townsfolk eager for his tresspassers' success. Unfortunately for everyone involved, 
  Grimmon also aged with uncanny maintanance of his intellect and had thwarted thousands of attempted  thefts. Combining his own creativity 
  with that of his attackers, Grimmon fortified and reinforced his estate, manor and vault just as constatntly as they were assaulted.

  "Of course there's a <em>secret</em> passage in middle of Town Square," scoffed Alyssa. "This city might actually be charming in another 
  era, but we had to show up when everybody's a cleptomanic, and the magic industry's on the fritz."
</p>
<p>
  "Relax," Max replied, "we fit right in with the cleptos, and the magic makes for some interesing sights."
</p>
<p>
  No sooner had they exited the Potent Potion than did they befall such a sight. Two robed figures were scurrying toward them, their pious 
  garb aflame.  "Stop, you two fools!" shouted an elderly gnome who was out sweeping his storefront across the street. "The magical smog is 
  explosive!"
</p>
<p>
  But it was too late, the hooded figures were mere paces away from the nearest cloud of hazy, green mist, and their momentum carried them 
  right into it. As magnificent emrald explosion engulfed the two figures, the blast echoed off the surrounding buildings, and a shockwave 
  sent Max and Alyssa reeling backwards over the street's uneven cobbles. As the smoke cleared, many onlookers gazed upon the two fallen 
  bodies. Where before their hair and skin were singed, sloughs of flesh now fell from their arms and faces.
</p>
<p>
  Alyssa gagged and swallowed back down a bit of acrid flem. "I think I could do without some of the local attractions."
</p>
<p>
  "What, that was awesome. They were all like, <i>Ahhh, help us! We're on fire,</i> and then BAM! And now you can practically see there 
  ribs poking out of their torsos," Max observed. "I should grab a femur for a cudgel or something."
</p>
<p>
  "You do that," Alyssa replied. "I'm going to check out what's going on in Town Sqare. Maybe <em>we</em> should be exploring the secret 
  passage, don't you think?"
</p>
<p>
  "Oh, yeah, you're probably right," said Max as they headed off together in that direction.
