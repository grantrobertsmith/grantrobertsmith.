  Originally, I was going to polish the piece I wrote yesterday because I thought it was too choppy in its transitions and that it lacked 
  the appropriate amount of character and location setup/description, but upon rereading it tonight, I feel it's maybe alright. Plus, 
  narrative exposition is one of the least interesting components of any story, so giving that task away to the reader's mind seems almost 
  better in my opinion. Ideally, it is done sparingly and with ample dry wit a la Rowling. At any rate, the real hard part is coming up 
  with the ideas for the pieces and last nights was rather a cop out since the main ideas were largely stolen from the D&D campaign that 
  Jordan created and I was only one of four members playing. That means I should definitely come up with the ideas for the other two pieces 
  that I goal(ed?) out for the 31st.

  On another note, I shared my universe concept with a couple folks at a party on Friday night, and it went fine. They seemed to like the 
  idea enough, and if anything I share reservations about the amount of divergence and interest therefrom that I've developed in the rest 
  of the space there. So, I can reasonably spend time thinking about how the universes would have shifted after the base event given the 
  assumption I made in either direction. Maybe universes only link when the divergence is super sharp or some stupid stipulation like that 
  could explain why there are only two universes of import, though I don't really think that fact needs to be explained at all necessarily.
