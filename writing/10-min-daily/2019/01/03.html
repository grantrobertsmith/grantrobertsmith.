  Even though they'd been together for years, Jeremy felt like he was meeting her for the first time. "Wow, you used to like ponies a lot."
</p>
<p>
  "Don't you mean <em>we</em> used to like ponies a lot? Or even, <em>I</em>?" she smiled back.
</p>
<p>
  "Yeah, I guess, but <em>I</em> didn't grow up liking ponies, that was you. I grew up liking dinosaurs and spaceships and cars. You know, 
  like a normal dude."

  Jennifer realized it was going to be a long haul getting used to their new situation, but she didn't realize she was going to have to 
  sweat the small stuff.
</p>
<p>
  <i>What do you mean small stuff? Oh... well, I'm glad I'll just get my way then.</i>
</p>
<p>
  "We know that's not what was meant," she said flattly.
</p>
<p>
  "<em>I</em> meant about just the way we think about our past," Jeremy replied.
</p>
<p>
  <i><em>And</em> you meant about our pronouns. <em>I</em></i>, she held up her hands together and parted them moving her right to the 
  right while leaving her left directly in front of her, <i>is only for the current state.</i>
</p>

Jeremy can promptly claim they're equally intelligent while messing up the pronouns, and she can ignore it, only he knows she's ignoring it
smuggly and he gets indignent and they realize that this is going to be much harder than so-and-so said it would be. ends with them reaffirming
their commitment to the process regardless of its difficulty and their commitment to each other / theirself
