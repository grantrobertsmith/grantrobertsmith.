  This one's going to be more of a diary than most. I want to do a bit more work, work yet tonight, so I've decided not to expend brain 
  power being creative. I found out that I need to interview again for Sunquest, which is fine, but I wish I had understood there would be 
  two rounds of interviews in the first place so that I could have set my expectations appropriately. I was kind of upset because I had set 
  an expectation that I would not have to interview again, and it's kind of my fault for not asking. At the same time, they could have told 
  me. Oh well, realizing that it was my expectations (why do humans even have these again) that were messed up helped me feel better about 
  it.
