  What would the world look like where surveilance were in the hands of the many, rather than the perview of the few? Wouldn't it just 
  further hasten and exacerbate the loss of privacy? What does it mean for everyone to have access to the latest and greatest capacity of 
  deep learning technology in terms of problem solving? Right now, it's mostly speech recognition, OCR, NLP, image recognition and 
  processing and story and art creation. Image creation as well I suppose. There must already be some pretty solid efforts if not also 
  results thereof that focus on a deep learning tool that improves upon the ability to generate deep learning tools, which seems trival to 
  then apply to itself. Of course it would still require a context for any given tool, be that the recursive deep learning modification or 
  the more "classical" applications. I think that means though that anything which can be boxed into a tight enough context, one which can 
  be exhaustively defined under some size of information set, can also be mastered by an algorithm. And of course the maximum size of such 
  an information set that an algorithm can handle is also increasing, so the number of tasks increases. It doesn't seem like there's any 
  obvious limit to this any more so than there is an obvious limit to a human's ability to take on new capacity. Plus, these things can be 
  used in combination.

  You open your eyes but see nothing. The ground is flat and hard and damp. It's smooth like polished marble or glass, maybe diamond. You 
  try to get up, but you cannot. You're too tired to even move. If you've ever experienced sleep paralysis, it's just like that but you're 
  ten times more certain that you're truly awake and that the only thing keeping you from moving is an artificial interuption between the 
  impulses your brain is sending out and your muscles ability to receive them. It's probably something about the environment that you can 
  feel but not see. You realize that can smell it too though, as damp as it feels, though the air is strangely dry at the same time. And 
  acrid. It's as if rain fell in a volcanic crater surrounded by an emmense desert.

  I'm not sure what that is, and it isn't very interesting, but at least I tried.
