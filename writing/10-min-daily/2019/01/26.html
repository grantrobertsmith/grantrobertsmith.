  10 minutes a day is super minimal, but at times like these I've still been lax with myself the past week or so. Let's see... I went 
  skydiving for the second time today (first time in over 3 years), and I went with my mom, so that was pretty cool. Also, Keira is in AZ 
  and was staying at my parent's house for the first time with me also here today, and that was pretty cool. I had a good conversation with 
  Lauren that even prompted some worthwhile thoughts just now as I was typing this, but I'm too tired to write those down coherently. Maybe 
  I'm just too lazy. Something about tradeoffs between time spent having all the meaningful conversations you want to have with people you 
  want to have them with and time spent actually getting things done in the world. Yawn!
