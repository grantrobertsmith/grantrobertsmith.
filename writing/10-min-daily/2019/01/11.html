  Originally I was going to watch more video lectures about convolutions as applied to deep learning algorithms for image identification, 
  but since I instead spent a bunch of time working on a silly interview question that required you to know binary exponentiation and 
  modular division reduction, I ened up learning those things instead. And, even though I set a goal of at least 10 minutes of "productive" 
  time for today, that's not happening, well, actually that practice can probably be considered productive... but that means it takes away 
  from my desire to now go and spend Grant-centric time on being productive especially since I also worked a fair amount today. At any 
  rate, I'm going to go home and sleep now, or at least soon.
