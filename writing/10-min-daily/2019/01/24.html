  Oh my god, I am exhausted. I just spent far too much time working on an algorithm for a practice interview problem that I had already 
  solved several other ways. The problem has to do with finding an array's maximum value, reducing that by half and then repeating this 
  process some large number of times. There are a few neat mathematical type solutions that work in the same relative time that it takes to 
  sort the array. Too bad I'm not really sure how knowledge of this algorithm is useful or applicable to other areas of computer science or 
  math. *shrugs*
