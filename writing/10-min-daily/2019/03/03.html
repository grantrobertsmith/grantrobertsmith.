  Trayden jumped onto the platform and tumpled sideways to avoid the lazer fire raining down from the Trilog alien menace 100 meters 
  farther up the tower. One blast left scorch marks just centimeters from his hand, but he had time only to glance down breifly to find his 
  next purchase on the platforms far side before sliding under the opposite railing and swinging underneath the platform where it overhung 
  a narrow balcony below. Letting himself drop to the floor below, he checked the door to make sure it was locked. After jumping over four 
  balconies more, he found an open window, lifted it and crawled through into an empty upscale residential unit.

  Looking around for the owner's 3D printer, he couldn't believe his luck when he spotted a Quixar model 3750jx. Inserting his plans for a 
  custom trunk that would fit under the sofa, he got the base started and took a moment to make sure he'd have time for the rest of the 
  design before his pursuit arrived. It was going to be close, but the window was probably still a viable exit if he couldn't find a door 
  to either of the neighboring units. As the bottom of his new hiding place finished, he manuevered into the tight space.

  As the container's walls neared completion, he setup his holographic nanodrone projectors to fake an exit. They hovered into the center 
  of the room and readied an escape display back out the window he'd entered. Several microdrones near the center of the fleet would blow 
  holes in server of the doors and windows on the floor below while Trayden rested safely in his custom container. As fabrication of the 
  final wall completed in front of his eyes, he heard ...

  Okay, that was better than expected. It's not particularly interesting, and I don't really know what's going on, but the quality of the 
  exposition for a rough draft is fine and that was way faster than it would have been had I reread and rewritten everything constantly 
  as I was writing it down. That said, having very few constraints made it much easier I think, so the next time I write, which I'm going 
  to say will be Friday at the latest, I think I should try this on the actual story that I'm writing picking up where I am currently 
  and working for ten minutes or until I get to the end of the initial scene - so, probably 10 minutes :)
