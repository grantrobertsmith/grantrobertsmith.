  The last two weeks have been fairly relaxing mentally - minus the lecture sessions on WorldCare software for the new job, which are 
  deluges of information being brain-dumbed on me - but somewhat physically exhausting, given all the flights and runs and logistics and 
  local transportation. I've obtained a good overview of Sunquest, Atlas and WorldCare, and I even have some work to be doing to help with 
  the LA County installs - build visio templates for form parts on each of 4 animal diseases. So far there's one and a half down, two and a 
  half remaining. With respect to run training for the marathon, I've been very on point overall - I suppose the ninja promise helps :-P. 
  With respect to writing sci-fi, I have been much less on point. These past two weeks I basically haven't written anything at all.

  I did realize that the procrastination habit I have is likely more worth breaking than any other. I should consistently be making 
  decisions about what to do and promptly doing it. If I'm deciding to relax or do thing, then that is okay, but if I'm telling myself that 
  I should be writing or reading or working and then following that with thought patterns that prevent me from doing so, the thought 
  patterns ought to be adjusted such that the original intent of the decision is carried out forthwith.
