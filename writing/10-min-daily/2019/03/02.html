  I'm postponing the writing exercise to tomorrow (technically later today). Instead I will just journal about how tired I was today after 
  taking the red-eye flight to visit Keira. I'm glad that in the future, I won't have to do that as much. (Within what is foreseeable, I 
  won't have to do it ever, but who really knows.) We still had fun playing and running around and watching cartoons, but it will be better 
  tomorrow and most other times going forward, when I am less tired.
