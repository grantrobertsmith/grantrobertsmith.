In the sense that humans benefit from increasingly accurate – complex – data flows, such pursuits are undoubtedly a good thing. Sadly, we 
often fall victim to the complexity of our poorly implemented systems. For example, the stock exchange responds to both factual and 
falsified data via the analysis of Twitter feeds. Ultimately, the impact of data flows is their use in optimizing various properties of the 
real world. Other dominant intersubjective realities like money and religion have the same position relative to human society. Therefore, 
we need to understand what properties of intersubjective realities are being maximized. Necessarily, one of the beneficiaries of any 
successful intersubjective reality is itself, and so transitioning the focus of society from one such guiding force to another would 
usually be best accomplished through experimentation, assuming that the things human society wants to optimize for are properties of humans 
themselves, which seems likely.

Heretofore, we have failed to take any precautions that might protect us from transitions in our focus as a species that may and often do 
have unintended consequences. We continue in this way today, and the only real corrective course is counterintuitive to modern man: slow 
down our own progress. This correction is non-obvious, but even more importantly, it's become actively dangerous. We are now on a course 
that needs some form of progress to correct it — Anthropomorphic climate change is cheif among these problems; overfishing and pollution 
are others. It's going to be a grand struggle to slow overall change while forcing as much change as possible in the few areas where it's 
truly needed.
