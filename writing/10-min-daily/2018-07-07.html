So yesterday evening in real life and this morning via Facebook Messenger, I was chatting with my friend Ali about overpopulation and about
whether it would be beneficial for humanity to have a designated population target. Regarding overpopulation, we agreed that it was moreso
a contributing factor that exacerbates other issues on Earth rather than a problem per se. I didn't really get to finish finding out his
reasoning for thinking that having a population target for Earth would be okay in a simulation but a poor idea in practice. I know it has
to do with the path of implementing the idea as much as it has to do with the idea itself. For example, he seemed to think that if we could
simulate a world where a population cap existed and everyone magically knew about a population cap, that it may be a good thing, but that
if we actually tried to go from our current world to a future state where we had a widely-know population cap, then any process for
reaching that state would be bad. I'm interested to have him read this and see to find out if it's an accurate approximation.

So, even assuming that devising a worthy path for implementing population targets is hard, Ali suggests that it is made even harder by the
fact that many such successful paths are bad. Maybe they would be bad because they would be likely to insight conflict around the idea
itself. This seems unlikely to me, since most people only fight about long held beliefs. New beliefs and ideas tend to be accepted or not
without much violence. At any rate, devising a path for Earth to adopt a population target in the first place seems hard enough, so I would
prefer to do that first and then adjust for any badness of it, rather than worry about its badness forthwith.

I guess the first step is to promote the idea of population targets for specific geographical areas generally, and then also for the entire
Earth as a geographical area specifically. The first thing that comes to mind is to write a bunch of short stories about all the ways that
having population targets could be bad. In other words, how could we poorly implement population targets, or how could we implement them in
such a way that they were so inflexible as to become bad as context around them changed. The latter seems easy to avoid, but the former
does not. Even avoiding the latter though requires some level of planning, and stories can be written about the failure thereof.
