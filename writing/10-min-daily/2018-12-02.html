Emotions make it real easy to fall pray to immediate gratification temptations. The last couple of hours I have been mentally thrashing 
over the failures of communication between a certain person and me that already span years of what will surely become decades. I ate some 
Nerds candies just because they were there. I wanted something that would inject a little instant pleasure into my being. What a waste! I'm 
not sure where this post was going. Originally I wanted to tie this personal failing of emotion and impulse to a larger trend, but I didn't 
really have anything in mind. Now, grasping at straws, my brain jumped to our trend of electing inept leaders just because they are 
different from usual scum we pick to make decisions on our behalf. It feels like a weak parallel. Sure, both things happen from a place of 
emotional failure, but there's little compulsion to be found at the societal level. I guess I feel a bit better somehow, even though this 
is a massive fail of a ten minute writing attempt.
