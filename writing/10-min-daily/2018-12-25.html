  Today I thought more about how to make time for things that I'd really like to be doing everyday but maybe am not currently doing. To 
  start, I acknowledge that there are at most a handfull things to do every single day: hygine, excercise and be productive in a way that I 
  fully choose to (as opposed to working for someone else or for an organization that I don't agree with at a rate of >95%). Hygiene is 
  easy because it takes very little time. It also goes with activities that happen roughly consistently everyday no matter what (waking up 
  and going to sleep). I have been doing progressively better making time to be productive through writing over the course of the last few 
  months. In particular, the past week I have been able to add accountability to a person outside myself, which has been motivating to an 
  extent that my consistency the past week =100%. The final thing I've been consistent with at some points in my life, but am not currently 
  making time for: working out. This is probably the most difficult thing because it is easy to get detered by sporadic difficulties over 
  which I have no control, like weather (since one activity I like to do is running outside).

  I think I can work with the coach who's been helping me on the acountability front for writing also help me with working out. I might be 
  able to add flexibility with respect to time of day (as opposed to just overcoming the weather outright - still, some days are shitty the 
  entire time). The consistency might be better than flexibility. Generally, the concept of priority has helped me a lot internally / 
  philosophically. But that alone doesn't really do it. I think I need a sort of check-in point once a week where I spend 15 minutes 
  contemplating the things that went well and why and the things that went poorly and why and ways to improve For the next week as well as 
  setting goals for the next week.
