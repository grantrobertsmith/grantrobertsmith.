Originally I planned to focus exclusively on overpopulation, population control, population tragets and the like. However, I'm finding it
difficult to think up new content on that topic every day. This is especially true when spend all of my time focusing on other topics these
days. Instead, I'll share a bit about my life, more like a diary. Sorry if it's boring. This weekend I went to Madison, Wisconsin to visit
my biological daughter, Keira. We went to the pool, played a few small pretend games, both with toys and completely imaginary - one
involved making each other into human burritos and then eating each other. It was fun in all. Also, rather than try to stay on topic, I'm
about to relax into a completely stream of consciousness writing style, my potential apologies for this too. This will likely occur in many
future entries.

Right now my brain is thrashing a lot. I keep trying to focus on this writing; it's only supposed to be 10 minutes of it, how hard can that
be? Quite hard apparently, especially without a spell-checking feature in the textbox you happen to be using. I just spent 90 seconds
trying to enable something of the sort and failed. Anyway, this isn't going well today, I've been at it 10 minutes anyawy (perhaps) and I
can be more productive at this point by going for a run.
