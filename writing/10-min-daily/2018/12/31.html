  This morning, I woke up able to remember my dreams reasonably well for the first time in quite a while. They also combined elements of 
  what I think were dreams that I have had before: climbing the tallest tree, a mansion/dungeon house with various video game like rooms, 
  and a gory one about a competition to the death in a setting reminiscent of ancient-Egypt. The main differentiator here was the feeling 
  of a tabletop game moreso than a video game, all though in all cases the dreams have been experienced from inside, so they feel real 
  regardless. Also, there were teams and resources of 11 different colors, which I don't remember from any other such dreams. 
  Unfortunately, I have already forgotten the main theme of any color that was defined in the dream, except that gray was plainness, and 
  white was clenliness and that dark red was violence. The other colors were blue, green, yellow, orange, red, purple, brown and black.

  These ideas fit somewhat with my name for the <i>ESCAPE</i> archetype from <a href="/assets/images/seven-paths.jpg">this graphic</a>: 
  <i>Dreamscape</i>.
