Probably pretty clear to most people, the thing that you do with your life should be a combination of what you're good at, what you enjoy 
and what provides value to the world. What I enjoy though is thinking, and thinking doesn't per se provide any value to the world: thoughts 
need to be shared and shared well in order to do so. Additionally the thoughts have to have merit unto themselves, and they need to be 
broadcast at a time when the listeners are amenible to their uptake. Notice that I'm not saying the thoughts have to be good or valuable or 
novel. That's a nice bonus, but really the impact of ideas are how well they spread. The content just determines the direction of their 
impact. So it's a bit of conundrum if you really enjoy thinking but not writing or speaking because without the latter there's no chance of 
meeting the third criteria. If you like thinking, you must develop an appreciation for content creation. You must get good at it too, if 
you want to turn a hobby into a vocation.

That's probably why I've ended up writing at all. I didn't logic it out with a goal of making money, but when you've had enough thoughts, 
it becomes increasingly likely that you have the thought to share some of them. Plus, the world isn't so infinitely interesting a place 
that it provides perpetually more things about which to think. And even if it were, generalization could kill the most fecund of 
dreamscapes.

Oddly, when I set out to write just now, I was planning to enumerate ways to spend my time that had nothing to do with writing; climate 
change, governance and technology were the intended topics. All of these are where people need to focus, but with the exception of climate 
change, progress in almost any direction within either of the other two fronts (and most other areas) benefits from discussion of ideas 
as much or more than from direct action. (Perpetual disclaimer: Maybe not so true in a dark forest.)
