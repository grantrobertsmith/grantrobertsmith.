Is there a way to model where we are going as a species? What will we value? What will our physical forms look like? What spaces - both 
physical and virtual - will we occupy? It's not a value, but it is something of a goal of mine to understand in a data-centric way, how do 
humans want to evolve. It's common to puruse historical trends to understand possible futures, to collect survey data to understand the 
present, and to build models to predict the future. But, most of our predictive models are relatively simple, and even those tend to be 
criticized rather harshly, often unfairly - without proffering alternatives. I'd like to create an exploratory model for mapping human 
values in the present to sci-fi societies toward which we might progress based on our emphasis of different values.

I worry, although perhaps not as much as I should, that such a model would be overly unscientific and therefore relatively meaningless, but 
perhaps there is also meaning in rhetorical models for driving discussion on the underlying themes and topics which may ultimately by 
digested in data-centric pieces. Plus over time, we would ideally compose such models into representations of ever more complicated systems 
to make decisions. So, even if the initial model is primarily based on assumption and conjecture, its existence compells the discovery of 
the data to ultimately support or refute its founding assumptions.

In terms of an initial project, my current skillset, while not completely inept at attempting such a project, is still woefully inadequate. 
Of course, we all begin this way, and that doesn't make it any less worthwhile. Another demotivating factor is my relative lack of interest 
in building a thing that would see no use. This of course is also likely foolish as its very existence would be useful for learning the 
missing skills, demonstrating both pre-posessed and learned skills, exemplifying commitment and at least providing the opportunity for 
sharing this tool/model/idea set with others. To not try is to fail, as they say.
