  When Lucia entered the room, it was empty. A dull glow eminated from every wall and from the floor and ceiling. As the door closed behind 
  her, she watched the gaps around its edges and hinges fill with the same dull, ubiquitous glow, leaving her with the feeling of being 
  immersed in a new mini universe of pale white light. To prevent disorientation, the room adopted an artificial shadowing affect in the 
  corners, and along the edges, and on the ground around where she stood.

<p>
  "Running simple meadow simulation: realism level 1," announced a soothing male voice.
</p>
<p>
  Light currents of warm air enveloped her. Lucia spun in place to take in the scene coming to life all around. Wildflowers sprang out of 
  the ground and tall grasses materialized all at once as particles of dust appeard to coalesce in midair. In the distance, she could see 
  birds flitting back and forth, and beyond that, hills rose before mountains to her left. The simulated experience of a vast, open plain 
  was quite neat and very impressive, but everything had a slightly animated quality too it, like she was standing in the middle of a video 
  game. She looked at the nacent sun and was not blinded, but rather shown a generated form of light rays shining out at an acute angle. 
  She reached out to touch a blade of grass, and her hand passed through it. She reached back toward the door and found the solid surface – 
  invisible but still present.
</p>
<p>
  "Simple meadow simulation: realism level 2," the voice continued.
</p>
<p>
  Instantly, the visual indications of artificiality vanished. There were no more video game sparks of light, no more notions of old-
  fashioned computer-generated imagery. Lucia bent down to feel the tall grass between her fingers, and this time it remained intact. 
  Reaching down farther, she pulled up a dandillion by the roots and shook off clumps of dirt hanging loosely below the plant. She blew at 
  the seeds and snatched one out of the air as they drifted away. In disbelief, she tried to trick the room by turning around and stepping 
  forward into where the wall must be, immediately behind her. Failing to make contact with the flat surface, she reached out and grasped 
  at the warm summer air. Stunned, she started walking, searching for the edge of the room. After several paces, she picked up her speed, 
  faster and faster until she was sprinting across the lea. She stopped suddenly, hoping to feel the floor adjust to her abrupt 
  decelleration, but everything felt completely natural.
</p>
<p>
  "Realism level 3 - all systems engaged."
</p>
<p>
  Lucia was incapable of noticing a difference. Her experience of level 3 was identical to level 2 – in every way. She sat down, feeling 
  light-headed.
