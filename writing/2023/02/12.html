<p>What’s Your Relationship to Your Own Parenting?</p>
<p>In general, I don’t feel like I parent much because of the custody and visitation issues. When I am parenting it’s mostly good but I’m 
definitely still learning constantly. I think not having a permanent house would make aspects of longer stays difficult, basically Keira
would never - or at least it would take longer for her to - feel like she has a space of her own when she is with me. Staying at one - or
as few as possible- place(s) consistently would help.</p>
</br>
<p>How do you feel about parenting now?</p>
<p>See above.</p>
</br>
<p>What are your frustrations?</p>
<p>I don’t do much of it.</p>
</br>
<p>What do you want to feel instead?</p>
<p>Like I am a parent more often.</p>
</br>
<p>What would you like to change about your behaviors?</p>
<p>Sometimes I don’t ask simple and straightforward and often enough questions of her mom. Sometimes I say she can’t go home when it would 
be more reasonable to just let her go home. Maybe it would be good for me to correct her a bit less often.</p>
